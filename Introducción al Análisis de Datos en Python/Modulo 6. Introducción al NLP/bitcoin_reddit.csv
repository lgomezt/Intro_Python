Friendly PSA, 100K is just another number;"Every time we hit a milestone, I post basically the same thing.  For those who have been a believer for 10+, 8+, 5+, 1+ years this is just another step.

I also bought a Coldcard and moved everything there so it would be harder to sell impulsively, and for added security.

These past few weeks have been super stressful, and they brought back all the crazy vibes of 2021. I was debating whether to sell or not, but I finally decided to cash out half of my investment to start 2025, debt-free!

;"It’s crucial for you to be aware of this info to help you avoid other potential mistakes. We all learn from them right? Right! 

First, you are still thinking of bitcoin like a stock where, if value goes up, sell to get profit. You have to break this mindset, as bitcoin is not like stocks. Bitcoin IS money. Bitcoin isn’t an investment. It’s the hardest form of money we as a species has ever had access to. What’s important here is Bitcoin is money OUTSIDE the dollar’s system. This is important. This means Bitcoin isn’t tied to the dollar’s dilution when the fed prints more, and thus it doesn’t inflate & lose value like the dollar does. Bitcoin is finite, yes, this does mean it goes up forever against the dollar. This is why selling your bitcoin to get dollars is a big mistake. 

You think you are getting ahead, but what is really happening is you are dipping your toe into the stream of prosperity which gets you ahead of where you were before, but you fall behind of where you could be. Some people (hopefully not you) keep dipping the toe in over and over never realizing you can bask in the waters of prosperity instead. 

I will say this last thing and then link you a video clip. Because bitcoin is finite, keep an eye on how much is being depleted from exchanges. Canges have had between 2 million and 2.5 million BTC on exchanges in recent months. This amount is dwindling as adoption is accelerating. You’ve got companies accelerating their buys, and you’ve got some of the smaller nation states and now the biggest nation states like the US pledging to buy bitcoin. This is going to deplete available bitcoin on exchanges very soon. When this happens, it’s going to go parabolic in ways that the human race is not used to. We are not used to having some high demand 100% finite. 

After the last having event, bitcoin became more scarce than gold officially. It’s daily replenishment rate is 450 bitcoins per day, and over 1000 bitcoins per day being bought up, and that is increasing. These bitcoins will run out in the very near future. If you aren’t in the bitcoin stream when that happens, you will be left behind. The gap and prosperity between those who don’t have bitcoin and those who do have bitcoin will be vast. And it seems like the only thing preventing you from realizing these facts is a bit of education and homework. I have provided a shortlist of videos to help you with this. And your immediate case make sure to watch clip #2, however, clip #4 is the real gem in this list. Once you watch cloak number four you’ll understand the difference between a currency (U.S. dollar), and actual money (first gold & silver, and now bitcoin). I hope all this information finds you well.

If a nonce is less than or equal to the target hash… why is “1” not always the correct answer ";TomBradysBallPump;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gx1wka/mining_question/;0;6.0;2024-11-22;06:50:50;Post;"Mining question Newbie, dumb question. Trying to learn about the mining process.

;"You try lots of different nonces to affect the hash of the block. The nonce can be anything; it’s the *hash* that needs to be under a certain value, not the nonce. Once you generate a hash less than the given value, you have created a valid block ready to add to the chain.

It’s very unlikely that the hash will come out as something low like 1 or 0 given that range to create a valid block is so huge (e.g. from 0x0 to 0x2c0700000000000000000000000000000000000000000)";HuntlyBypassSurgeon;;2;0.0;2024-11-22;08:29:01;Comment;" You try lots of different nonces to affect the hash of the block.

That's not quite right.  From the [bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nonce):

> The ""nonce"" in a bitcoin block is a 32-bit (4-byte) field whose value is adjusted by miners so that **the hash of the block** will be less than or equal to the current target of the network.

;"They are trying to get the resulting *hash* to be smaller than a certain number. 

It cannot be predicted so the only way is to change the message a little bit and hash, and if it’s not smaller then change the message a little bit and hash again and so on. Until your hash meet (lower than) the target. 

The little bit of change is the nonce. So it doesn’t matter what that is, you can start from 1, then 2, 3 etc. the idea is that you have a list of transactions that are sort of fixed, so you need a field that’s variable so that you can generate different hashes without touching the transaction data.

;"Okay to explain further, the offers are not fake per se. All the offers you see in the book at an exchange are real. It's just that the person who makes the offer may not have a genuine intention to sell, but just to put it on the table to create an illusion that he intends to sell. 

Why do that though? To manipulate perception. 

For example, a whale with 10000 bitcoins can put all of it up for sale at $100000. But he doesn't intend to sell. Instead, he just puts it there to make people think that there's a big scary wall of 10000 bitcoins waiting at the $100000 mark, which in turn, can cause people to front run the $100000 mark, which allows the whale to pick up tons of sub $100000 coins. Once it almost reaches the $100000 price though, he promptly cancels his offer and the wall disappears. And then the price soars beyond $100000, earning the whale a pretty profit while those who sold to him cry. 

Of course the example above is extremely simplified and while whales do have the power to manipulate, it is not as easy as the example given.";wc_house;;14;0.0;2024-11-22;10:02:26;Comment;" Okay to explain further, the offers are not fake per se.

Only less than 20 million people could ever own a full bitcoin;"Yes, I know this is nothing new but that’s still insane to me. I can’t stop thinking about it. If everyone on Earth wanted just one Bitcoin, it’s simply not possible. There are 8 billion people, but only 21 million Bitcoins. Think about that. If you have just one Bitcoin, or even 0.1 Bitcoin, you’re already in the top 1% of Bitcoin holders compared to the rest of the world, where most people have none. That’s wild.

And Bitcoin is already becoming something bigger, a true recognized decentralized global currency, maybe even a reserve currency. It’s like the perfect kind of money, a store of value, a form of digital capital that anyone, anywhere, can access. The fact that its supply is limited? That changes everything. As Bitcoin keeps getting more valuable, it’s going to get even more scarce. People who own Bitcoin are going to think twice, and even, three times, before they sell, because once it’s gone, there’s a **damn** good chance you’ll never get the same amount back.

That scares me. It really does. I can only bring myself to buy, never sell. Selling feels impossible because how do you let go of something that just keeps gaining value over time? It’s like selling a piece of the future.

I love and hate Bitcoin for that exact reason. I hate that I didn’t buy more when I had the chance, back when it felt like a fun idea and a way to make some money and not the first globally recognized digital currency I now know it is. If I could go back, I’d buy as much as I could. But that’s pointless now, I can’t change the past. All I can do is keep buying, no matter what. If Bitcoin drops in price? Great, I can buy more for less. If it skyrockets? Even better, because that just means we’re getting closer to the freedom Bitcoin can one day help provide.

This thing isn’t just an investment for me, it’s a way of thinking. Bitcoin forces you to see the world differently. It makes you question the value of money, the systems we’ve built, and even your own decisions. For the first time in history, we have a form of money that no government can manipulate, no central bank can print into oblivion, and no elite can control. Yet, governments now want it, banks now want it, investment firms now want it, and the elites now want it more than ever.

Wallet questions. Actually owning ;"Hello

I have some small amount in bitcoin in Robinhood. After reading through some threads here I realize I should have probably went with crypto.com (I have some other already in that) I also already have trust wallet. 

My question is, when using Robinhood it seems as if it is not your actual crypto. How would I remedy this? Sell my crypto on Robinhood. Get the cash and then buy the same crypto on crypto.com and then send it to trust wallet? 

If that is the case. What do you guys use to track your gains and losses? Since it shows it on Robinhood already what I have lost and gained. 

Thank you

Both Robinhood and crypto.com are terrible platforms, we call them shitcoin casinos. At any time they can block your account for whatever reason, all your purchases are KYCed, thus drawing a target on your back in case of leaks etc.

Trust Wallet is not to be trusted as well. It's a shitcoin wallet from Binance. Binance is yet another shitcoin casino you should avoid, not trust. 

There are plenty of wallets you can use that are open and not affiliated with shady companies. But if your stack is at least a bit significant, you should, in general, avoid single sig software wallets. If your phone/laptop is hacked, everything is gone in seconds. 

Instead, you can use something like Sparrow with a hardware wallet or multisig etc.";only_merit;;1;0.0;2024-11-22;08:15:41;Comment;" > in Robinhood.

When will decentralization start mooning an ATH in other sectors of life? ;"Bitcoin enables borderless transactions. No banks required. Easy enough.The world is becoming increasingly stateless, virtual, and digital.

Yet I cannot register a car's license plate unless I have a permanent physical address. That's the same notion as requiring a geospatial brick and mortar bank with a singular account, instead of the dynamic addresses of crypto networks that we're shifting to.

The remote work gig economy, crypto, and Airbnb/Vrbo all enable digital nomads, but there is somehow a mandatory contract with banks or landlords required to have a car? *Unnecessarily restrictive. Outdated.* In 2024 people are way more mobile than they were when the license plate system was created (~1901 in the US). Put a QR code on it that can be updated online and be done with the physical bureaucracy. Simple. 

And that's just one example. It's not only a FinTech revolution.

Honestly depressed!;So, here’s the thing - my brain is totally in a whirlwind right now. Even though I was tracking BTC since the last bullrun, but my financial situation was beyond horrible and I couldn't afford, back in January 2024, I made a serious decision to buy Bitcoin, I remember the price was around $40k-$50k. Guess what? I don't know why tf I sold them all by the end of September, even though I was constantly telling everyone to hold on or even wait for a big bull run. If I had just been a little bit more patient, I could have made enough money for a down payment! I withdrew all my Bitcoin in Fiat, and since then, I’ve been just refreshing the app and checking the prices. I even took a whole day off from work to get back even, but it’s a bit late now. So, I’m thinking of going back and buying, buying, and keeping it as an asset instead of selling it in the future. What do you guys think?

;"I never sold, but I definitely didn’t buy as much as I could when I had fiat lying around. I also feel deep regret. On top of that, in 2020 I gave my brother 100€ to buy BTC for me (I didn’t have my own account on any exchange back then and I trusted him because he had been in the game for years already). He managed to sell for a shitcoin worth nothing today. (Conclusion: never trust anyone).

All of that to say that most of us have regrets about past decisions (or lack of) regarding bitcoin. Since we can’t go back to the past and do what we now wish we did back then, I think that the most important now is to get back on track. By that I mean to keep buying BTC, developing your knowledge about it, its role on global economics and its impact on society, and learning how to protect your coins (by putting them on a hardware wallet instead of keeping them on an exchange platform).

This is known as [structuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuring#:~:text=6%20External%20links-,Definition,by%20regulators%20and%20law%20enforcement.), and it's a crime punishable by a fine and up to 5 years in federal prison.

;"First of all. I would advise against tax fraud, but this is probably not news to you. I’m pretty sure The IRS has requested user data from Coinbase before, so I don’t know why they wouldn’t continue doing that, thereby find out that you sold your bitcoin, and owe them taxes. Depending on the amount, you would probably be better off taking ‘em off Coinbase and trying to sell them face-face or over bisq.

If you are American, the 15% seem like a cheap fee to know you can sleep well at night.

I don’t have any recommendations for fees. I hate Coinbase, so I would go elsewhere, but I understand why you don’t want to go through KYC just to sell all your bitcoin. Bisq is KYC free, and I think the spread is normally favoring the bitcoin sellers, because some people don’t mind paying more for KYC free bitcoin. The process will be slower and more involved though, and the bank might want to know where all the money you receive comes from.   ";Laukess;;2;0.0;2024-11-22;08:28:54;Comment;" First of all.

Are We Witnessing the End of the Economy as We Know It?;"Hi everyone! I’m new here and relatively new to Bitcoin (I’ve known about crypto since I was a kid, but I never had the money to invest). I wanted to ask you all something: What do you think about this situation with Bitcoin? Let me share my thoughts, and maybe we can exchange ideas about it.

I’m from Argentina, a really beautiful country with a really BIG problem: politicians. These people (if I can even call them that) see politics as a way to make money, not as a way to help people. Over time, politicians have destroyed Argentina’s economy. We’ve been, and still are, one of the countries with the highest inflation rates in the world. Here, you can’t save money, and if you do manage to save a little, you definitely can’t save in *pesos argentinos* because politicians have exploited the peso for their own gain, leaving people poorer. Our last government even blamed inflation on ""demons."" Yep, our politicians think people are that stupid.

I’ve started to understand the power of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, no one can steal the fruits of your labor. No one can print more money and make you poorer. No one can spy on your financial privacy or take money out of your pocket unlike the politicians in my country who do exactly that.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are transforming the economy as we know it. People are waking up. I don’t want to lose the value of my hard work or my dreams. Inflation is a massive problem worldwide every month, your fiat money loses value. Here’s my take: In the coming years, Bitcoin’s value will keep rising (as it’s doing now) and will likely become a true store-of-value asset (I know that currently, it is, but I'm trying to say that more people will adopt bitcoin as store of value).

I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. We might be witnessing a massive economic shift. The more people wake up, the freer we become. In my opinion, there’s no such thing as a “bad time” to buy Bitcoin. Why? Because if the price drops, it doesn’t matter. The current economic systems in every country can’t compete with Bitcoin, and sooner or later, its price will rise again.

;"I think it is a massive shift and a new tool that reduces several barriers, but it is a stretch to view BTC as a complete change in global economics.

Why Does Owning a Bitcoin ETF Feel Different Than Holding Bitcoin in a Wallet?;"I know the technical differences between owning a Bitcoin ETF and holding Bitcoin directly in a wallet, so this isn’t about the mechanics. What I’m curious about is the psychological side of it.

Longtime lurker, first time buyer. I felt absolutely crazy dumping as much bread as I can afford into Bitcoin at 90k, but am I really?;"Been looking into crypto, mostly Bitcoin with interest for years. My first experience was around 2018, when I sold a motorcycle to someone and they paid me in Bitcoin, totaling about .5 btc. They helped me set up my BRD wallet to receive it (Rip). A few days later, I transferred the money to my bank, not knowing much about it and not wanting to take a risk. 

In 2022, while my house was sitting skyhigh and bitcoin was floorlow, I again looked into getting some. Decided against it, not knowing if it would ever come up again.

Watching it skyrocket after the election, I realized BTC is something different. It’s a resilient fucker. It blows expectations out of the water every time. It shoots low and comes right back up, higher then we thought possible each bull run. Now with institutional adoption, the significant media attention that’s about to hit at 100k, legality in China, ect. I believe this is the start of something huge. 100k could mean huge selloffs, huge spikes or no change at all. 

So I went in with everything I could afford to lose. Because you know what? Even if it crashes, I’m holding on and buying more. It will come back, and you only should sell if you have to. BTC is here to stay, and the sooner you get in the better.

To the moon ya’ll 🚀

Newbie here;"Sorry if this gets asked a lot but…

I have been on the fence about bitcoin for a while and after learning more about it from someone who’s been into Crypto and bitcoin for 7+ years I finally pulled the trigger and bought $20 worth on PayPal. 

I understand that’s not ideal and that’s why I come here asking how I can better understand cold storage and what exchanges are the best. One concern I had about exchanges was payment and I wanted to know if there were some that take Apple Pay or PayPal? 

I also wanted to know if exchanges would allow me to securely direct deposit the purchased satoshis to an exodus wallet until I can purchase a proper hardware wallet for cold storage. 

Lastly when I do hold bitcoin in exodus or a hardware wallet is it possible to quickly transfer the assets to an exchange to sell when I desire? I am aiming on holding bitcoin for 5-10+ years.

Bonus points: are there any exchanges that do not ask for a social security number?

Quick update: I just found out I can purchase bitcoin using PayPal directly to my exodus wallet. So my self custody dilemma is solved. ";Casual-Gamer25;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gwsy75/newbie_here/;4;5.0;2024-11-21;22:59:49;Post;"Newbie here Sorry if this gets asked a lot but…

;"Easiest way is to open a Coinbase account, transfer money in, and buy. Could also easily just buy crypto in Paypal. You can buy in any amount. So if you a curious, just do it. The purists will say to hold your own coins in a trezor wallet or similar. You would control your bitcoin keys. In the past there have been many exchange collapses, so this is reasonable advice, but storing in the coinbase vault has worked for me. Others will disagree :)

Only buy what you can afford, or you will panic sell when it goes down.  And it will go down. Maybe from 98k to 75k, maybe from 250k to 120k. It will seem like apocolypse.

I was wondering if you’d heard of a little website called schoolofbitcoin.com

It’s an education website to teach people about bitcoin. There are three free lessons and the rest you can pay for which cost about $50 USD. It’s in it’s early stages but if there are anybody you want to teach or anything you wanna learn then head on down!

I’m not surprised!;"It’s been a long time folks. We have marched in the shadows for years. We are making our way though and will soon reach the promised land. For over 10 years they have mocked us and told us we are crazy. Eventually everyone starts to see the light though. 

I just want to say that as someone who owns bitcoin from the $300 valuation years back, I still continue to add to my pile over time. I am still buying at these prices, it makes no difference. Every price will be low if Bitcoin takes off, it’s the greatest asymmetric bet you could ever make with pretty damn good odds. 

Bitcoin has only grown in value over the years and it makes it no worse today than it was long ago. Just because it’s more expensive doesn’t mean I don’t want it anymore. I continue to buy it, stack it, and will forever hold it. Sure, I will spend it when needed, but I won’t over consume for no reason.

Cold Card Question;"I'm looking for a reliable, open source hardware wallet and was considering cold card.  I had a couple of concerns with Cold Card... hopefully not too ""noobish"".

To update the firmware you use an SD card to download the update online, and then transfer it to your cold card... isn't that a bit of a risk to use an SD card that has been connected to a laptop?

I'm still a bit confused as to how it's considered air gapped, if you still need to connect to a third party wallet in order to send transactions / view your wallet content etc... if you're connecting to something like nunchuk wallet, how are you still air gapped?

;"The Coldcard devices usually come with the latest firmware. So you might not have to update it for a long time. I think the main risk there would be compromised firmware and not so much compromised SD card hardware or filesystems with some sort of exploit.

Trezor vs Bitkey (BTC only);"Bitkey is easy to setup without the need of seed phrase. When receiving, bitkey device is not needed. It has the ability to setup transfer amount without the need of bitkey device. Easy fingerprint activation with NF for fast and smooth sending.
*I understand without self custody it’s unsafe, but the way bitkey is set up, I really don’t see how it could potentially be a hazard. Device + Phone + server.
1. The server can not transfer due to 2-3sig feature.
2. If device breaks, order new one. Let say no longer available, we still have phone+server to transfer(unsure how this is handled? Call Bitkey directly?)

4. If phone dies, it’s saved on iCloud. Hacking/leaking iCloud login is unlikely. (I had an old iCloud lost due to password. No device with logins, only phone number that’s linked to new iCloud. Yet, with all the information I still had trouble recovering the password/reset request. Toke about 4years+ to finally managed to get reset, phone number was the important factor)
5. There’s the trusted contact as well. And lastly recovery file that’s currently android only.

Am I missing something that’s not mentioned as to why people dislike or not favoring Bitkey?? I really prefer to stay with Bitkey so that I do not have to worry about seed phrase.
Please advise if I missed anything.

When receiving, bitkey device is not needed. It has the ability to setup transfer amount without the need of bitkey device. Easy fingerprint activation with NF for fast and smooth sending.
*I understand without self custody it’s unsafe, but the way bitkey is set up, I really don’t see how it could potentially be a hazard. Device + Phone + server.
1. The server can not transfer due to 2-3sig feature.
2. If device breaks, order new one. Let say no longer available, we still have phone+server to transfer(unsure how this is handled? Call Bitkey directly?)

THIS POST IS ONLY AIMED AT NEW FOLKS LOOKING TO BUY FOR THE FIRST TIME.   
Okay, carry on).  
  
Say, you are currently married for some time already. With kids, house, steep monthly bills, all that. And inevitably, some marital issues have already reared their ugly head as well, but you are working on it. And now, you are looking at this hot market, and thinking about buying in for the first time.

Sure, we are all ecstatic about the numbers going up up up right now, and it's quite likely that they will continue going up in the near future, but there really is no guarantee that this is the cycle that will end all cycles. There might still be a bear market / crypto winter ahead, which lasts for years, with average values considerably lower than the current price.

Trust me when I say this - your wife will not look well on those red numbers for that long of a time. You and I know it is only temporary and that there will inevitably be a next bull cycle in 2028, and we are bound to see the coveted $1M price at some time in the future. But, assuming you have a ""normie"" wife, she will not see it like that. She sees you, ""gambling"" on your mutual financial future, and your kids' opportunities later in life.

Are your potential earnings down the road really worth this extra stress on your marriage? Is your marriage stable enough to survive this scenario? Are you 100% certain that this is indeed the start of the *hyperbitcoinization*? If yes to all that, go for it, by all means. If not... please consider if the marital risk is worth it, or if you might possibly be better off to postpone buying in until we get to the next bear phase again.

*(And yes - unfortunately I do speak from experience.)*";racecrack;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gwnbw6/a_word_of_warning_to_the_married_fellows_on_here/;0;19.0;2024-11-21;19:03:16;Post;"A word of warning to the married fellows on here (EDIT: Was trying to change the title to better reflect my intention, but apparently I can't:

Say, you are currently married for some time already. With kids, house, steep monthly bills, all that. And inevitably, some marital issues have already reared their ugly head as well, but you are working on it. And now, you are looking at this hot market, and thinking about buying in for the first time.

Sure, we are all ecstatic about the numbers going up up up right now, and it's quite likely that they will continue going up in the near future, but there really is no guarantee that this is the cycle that will end all cycles. There might still be a bear market / crypto winter ahead, which lasts for years, with average values considerably lower than the current price.

Trust me when I say this - your wife will not look well on those red numbers for that long of a time. You and I know it is only temporary and that there will inevitably be a next bull cycle in 2028, and we are bound to see the coveted $1M price at some time in the future. But, assuming you have a ""normie"" wife, she will not see it like that. She sees you, ""gambling"" on your mutual financial future, and your kids' opportunities later in life.

Are your potential earnings down the road really worth this extra stress on your marriage? Is your marriage stable enough to survive this scenario? Are you 100% certain that this is indeed the start of the *hyperbitcoinization*? If yes to all that, go for it, by all means. If not... please consider if the marital risk is worth it, or if you might possibly be better off to postpone buying in until we get to the next bear phase again.

*(And yes - unfortunately I do speak from experience.)*"

;Definitely not the norm. My last two girlfriends were obsessed with travel. We are talking 6+ trips a year.

;"That's not how market caps work. If you try to buy up all the BTC right now you won't get every one at 95k, as soon as you start buying price shoots up. Your demand will affect the price and therefore the marketcap and it will be an ever moving target that you will never reach. BTC would reach 18T cap long before you were able to spend that amount.


 That's how the Hunt Brothers went bankrupt trying to corner the silver market.

Best way to DCA Bitcoin in the US?;"Hey like I do with my IRA I would love to buy X amount of Bitcoin every two weeks (every paycheck) and store it in a secure Bitcoin wallet.

I have a Coinbase and Gemini exchange account but if you recommend another platform I don't mind creating a new account. (USA as a reminder)

I would like to store the Bitcoin in a wallet and I am open to using a hardware or software wallet. I would like it to be secure of course but also simple and quick to use.

One of my main concerns is fees especially if I am going to buy and transfer Bitcoin every two weeks. If there are exchanges, wallets, or strategies to lower fees please share your recommendations.

Lastly my IRA is automated. I don't mind doing this manually but if there is a way to automate this that would be really cool.

;"If you’re looking to store your bitcoin in a custodial IRA, Swan Bitcoin or Unchained Capital would be your best bet. But if you take the route of Bitcoin IN your IRA, there will be fees regardless, especially if you decide to go the multi-custodial route. Other exchanges are Choice Kingdom Trust and iTrustCapital, but I don’t know if you’ll actually own your bitcoin with iTrust Capital. DCA might not be a good idea in any IRA’s b/c of the transaction fees they charge. Also be aware of the maintenance fees any of them might charge.

If you pull the trigger, It makes the most sense to hold BTC in a Roth IRA just fyi. And make sure to get a breakdown of any ongoing fees.

;"Tax-wise it’s pretty simple if you put it in a Roth.
But there’s rules on custodying crypto / BTC in the U.S. for IRA’s.

I had to set up an LLC through my provider and have the LLC hold the Roth / BTC and only then was I able to hold the crypto in my account. That’s the best way I can think of to hold it.

The Future;"As BTC approaches $100,000, I’d like to thank this forum for introducing me to Bitcoin.

I was taught the old school investing strategies of Warren Buffet like “only invest in things you understand” and that compound interest was the only way to get ahead.

But after years of investing regularly, the rise of inflation, and the relentless taxes from Uncle Sam, it felt like I was stuck spinning in a hamster wheel. I knew I’d have to get creative and start looking for other ways.

Enter this forum.

I’d heard of Bitcoin before but thought it was just a casual “asset” not meant to be taken seriously. But I looked into it anyway. The further into it I got, the further I was convinced. I read books like the Bitcoin Standard, Creature from Jekyll Island, listened to podcasts, YouTube videos, and more. It wasn’t long after that I realized this casual “asset” actually was one.

Since then, I’ve been on recurring weekly buys for about a year now and it feels very freeing. So as we approach $100,000, I’d like to say thank you to this community for opening my eyes. 

We’re just getting started.

Hi everyone, I've been working in my humble contribution to the BTC community. This website is a resource to get all the bitcoin assets you might need FOR FREE, in high quality and editable. Think of it as a bitcoin brand resource as you would have in a company. My purpose is to grow it over time, improve it, and provide a trusted source for the bitcoin brand logos and creative materials that can help anyone that might need it.

Here's the site:  
[https://bitcoinlogo.xyz/](https://bitcoinlogo.xyz/)

I took the time to unify, recreate and expand on the many versions of the bitcoin mark out there, trying to establish a baseline. Over the years,  every time I needed to use a bitcoin logo I never found a good resource and I always resorted to use a low quality version from Google. This website offers PNGs, SVGs, Typography, Color codes and even a Figma file with all the assets for you to download for free.

I'm a brand and product designer with 15+ years of experience working for companies like Netflix, Disney, MasterCard, and many more.  
I hope you find this helpful and can help me reach more people that might need it.  
Best!

Tax nightmare;"Alright y'all. Here's my dilemma.

I've been acquiring various different cryptocurrencies since 2018. When I first started out, it was strictly a hobby and I did a lot of swapping one coin for another and lost a few grand here and there as I learned the in's and out's of the system. Like I said, just a hobby with a lot of disposable income. When I finally got to a point where I was comfortable with my knowledge of crypto, I doubled down and began regular purchases totaling about 10% of my paycheck every two weeks which continued up until I got laid off this past April. I've managed to build a nice little nest egg. After being laid off in April, this year is the first time I've had to sell any of my crypto since my experimental phase in 2018. My question is in regards to taxes. 

How can I report accurate cost basis data when most of my crypto was acquired in small quantities over time, all at different prices AND when some of my crypto is from that experimental phase when I was swapping back and forth frequently? Surely this is a common issue. How strict is the IRS in regards to having ultra accurate tax data? Is it okay to guess-timate? I anticipate this becoming an even bigger issue next tax year as my current plan is to hold my bitcoin indefinitely but cash out my other crypto holdings as close to the top of the market as I can manage.";EnvironmentalShape42;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gwkiju/tax_nightmare/;0;20.0;2024-11-21;17:15:02;Post;"Tax nightmare Alright y'all.

;IRS told everyone how to track everything in 2014 so you should have known. You're gonna need to do best you can from records you can pull and generally overpay tax where you can't properly account for every trade. Clear everything up by end of this year so you have a clean slate of bitcoin only starting Jan 1. Sell off all shitcoins and maybe even bitcoin that is a short term hold. Rebuy in '25 with new cost basis with dates and amounts properly recorded in a spreadsheet. See irs.gov for details. I can easily record and report by hand (well, in excel, not on paper) 10-12 trades a year.

You'll owe taxes on any gains made when swapping, not just selling

Have you not been reporting anything since 2018? If so, yikes - you have a lot of work hunting down any/all tax liabilities in that time. You'll need to go back and find all cost basis at the time of purchases, cost basis at the time of swaps, and cost basis at the time of sale.

(Cost at time of sale or swap) - (Cost to acquire) = taxable amount. You'll also need dates for acquisition and swap/sale

If you've got lots of smaller purchases over time, you'll have a long list.

If the difference in dates is greater than one year, it'll be reported on a different form (other income) than if it's less than 1 year (capital gains)

It can be grueling to dig back in time to get all this data, and sometimes you may not have exact costs, in which case you can do a lookup for avg price on a certain date. 

You can hire a tax pro, but they'll still need you to pull all of this info regardless. They'll just do the math and make sure it's all reported on the correct forms. 

I recommend you start logging all of this info on an ongoing basis in a spreadsheet
Columns should be something like: Transaction type (purchase, swap, sale, airdrop, gift/learning rewards), Asset, amount of coins/tokens acquired, date acquired, value of asset at the time, value of purchase/sale in $.

It'll make your life much easier moving forward, but not really a way to make it easier retroactively. Just tedious work

;"Cointracking.  

It'll cost you a few $ (or pay w bitcoin)

Weather you've traded on exchange, put assets in a cold wallet, or traded on decentralized exchanges, Cointracking can pull all that info.  -  As long as you're exchange accounts are still open, you can usually set up a ""watch only"" API and it'll pull everything in.  For DEX wallets, you put your public address in their system and they pull all the tx from that address.  With cold wallet tx, you have to export your history to an excel sheet and upload that. 

It takes a bit to set up, but it's nice once it's set up.  You can run tax reports at any point, for any specific period of time.  It's cool cause you can check your tax burden after each trade if you want to.

The most interesting thing I've heard recently;"Basically, that TSLA lost a lot of its short sellers when it put BTC on the balance sheet because this represents exogenous melt-up risk.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDxaBWc1yg

I hadn't considered that before. But there is a whole industry around shorting stocks then releasing negative (and arguably fabricated) press about those companies to induce selling.

If enough companies take a Bitcoin treasury approach this becomes wildly risky for the short sellers. If enough companies do it, it becomes table stakes / required.

Germany's $2.35 Billion Bitcoin Misstep: A Lesson in Market Timing;"The German government recently offloaded 50,000 BTC at a price of $55,000 per coin, a decision that initially may have seemed like a strategic move to capitalize on Bitcoin’s value at the time. However, in the weeks that followed, Bitcoin’s price surged by an impressive 85%, significantly altering the narrative.

Had they held onto their position, the German government would have reaped an additional $2.35 billion in profits. This highlights the complexities of timing the market, even for institutions. It’s a reminder that in the crypto space, price volatility isn’t just a risk—it’s also an opportunity, one that can lead to massive gains or, in this case, substantial missed potential.

;I could see it rallying through the end of the year. Nobody’s sitting on losses right now, and with big institutions now involved, I don’t think we’ll see a huge sell-off over the next month. People are likely trying to avoid triggering capital gains taxes this year. If there were a huge sell-off, it’s hard to imagine how much the government would lose in capital gains tax revenue since the lack of a wash-sale rule lets investors harvest the loss, offset other gains, and jump right back in.;Zipski577;;12;0.0;2024-11-21;14:31:01;Comment; I could see it rallying through the end of the year.

Gold mining;"I just watched a documentary about gold mining in Bolivia. Gold mines there completely destroy the land, being operated normally on an illegal basis by chinese, brazilian or other foreign companies. The land can't be used to plant food anymore, so the only source is the local river which provides fish. Well, the gold miners use quacksilver to wash out the gold, which gets into the local rivers, poisoning the population and being extremly harmful, especially for kids.

Now this leads me to Bitcoin - still being portrayed by mass media as very harmful for the environment. Imagine the people in that same region would be able to use their local river for energy to mine Bitcoin instead!? They would be able to leverage renewable resources, continue planting their foods and eat the fish in the river without any health concerns - while being able to recoup their investment by selling a portion of their Bitcoin. 

Imagine how many similar stories there are around the world, use cases for Bitcoin for people that have no idea what it even is. THAT is the reason I'm excited about 100k per coin, it will be reported around the world and hopefully trigger some rethinking of how to participate and how this sound money could help anyone in a difficult situation (individual or community) set themselves free from opression - from a tyranical government, centralized FIAT currency enforcement, or exploitative corporations.

I asked my friend Claude 3.5 to make a honey badger prediction;"I'll provide a scenario-based analysis of Bitcoin's potential performance based on historical trends, government adoption, and potential future scenarios.

Historical Context:
- 2009: Bitcoin created
- 2013: First major price surge to ~$1,100
- 2017: Reached ~$19,800
- 2021: All-time high of ~$69,000
- 2022-2023: Significant volatility and market correction

Government Treasury Adoption Trends:
1. El Salvador - First country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender (2021)
2. Central African Republic - Second country to adopt Bitcoin (2022)
3. Emerging trend of countries considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset

Scenario Analysis for Bitcoin Performance (2024-2030):

- 2024: $100,000 - Significant institutional adoption
- 2025: $150,000 - Multiple countries add to reserves
- 2026: $250,000 - Global financial system integration
- 2027: $350,000 - Widespread cryptocurrency acceptance
- 2028: $500,000 - Major economic powers adopt
- 2029: $650,000 - Global financial restructuring
- 2030: $1,000,000 - Transformative financial technology status

Factors Influencing Potential Performance:
1. Regulatory Environment
- Positive: Clear, supportive regulations
- Negative: Strict government restrictions

2. Technological Developments
- Lightning Network improvements
- Enhanced security protocols
- Scalability solutions

3. Institutional Adoption
- Corporate treasury investments
- Investment fund allocations
- Payment system integrations

4. Macroeconomic Conditions
- Inflation rates
- Global economic stability
- Geopolitical tensions

5. Potential Government Treasury Adoption Indicators:
- Countries likely to consider Bitcoin reserves:
  * Developing economies with unstable currencies
  * Countries seeking to diversify foreign reserves
  * Nations with high inflation rates
  * Tech-forward economies

Potential Government Adoption Strategy Progression:
- 2024-2026: Experimental allocation (1-5% of reserves)
- 2027-2029: Increased allocation (5-10% of reserves)
- 2030 and beyond: Potential mainstream integration

Caveats:
- This is a speculative analysis
- Cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Significant risks remain in cryptocurrency investments

Recommendation:
- Conduct thorough personal research
- Consult financial advisors
- Understand and manage personal risk tolerance
- Consider diversification

Future setbacks? ;"What do you think could push back the price of bitcoin in the next year? Given the current hype and positive signs from Trump, Bitcoin has never been in such a promising position.

Best way to cash out in Germany?;"I've been holding BTC since 2017 and am ready to cash out about a third of it, approximately 80k EUR. Currently, it's stored in a cold wallet. I am looking for the most convenient and reliable way to exchange my BTC to EUR, and then send it to my German bank account via SEPA transfer. I have never done this before. 

I have verified accounts with Kraken and Binance. Kraken seems like the best option but I'm really turned off by all of the recent complaints from German customers. With Kraken, deposits of more than 25k EUR will be frozen until a proof-of-source-of-funds document is uploaded and verified. Verification can take ages and I don't want my funds to be frozen under any circumstances. I also don't want to take the risk that they reject my POSOF document. Then what? Who knows.

The Value of Changed Opinions: A Reflection on Bitcoin;"
Throughout my life, I’ve adhered to many different principles, but one stands out when forming opinions: the weight I give to others’ views depends heavily on how those views were formed.

Whenever I encounter a new topic or subject, my first step is to listen to a wide range of opinions—those I respect and those I don’t. These perspectives act as a foundation, but they’re never the final word. I dig deeper, conduct my own research, and form my own conclusions. However, there’s one key factor that influences how much value I place on an opinion: **whether that opinion has changed over time.**

I find far greater value in the opinion of someone who has had their mind changed than in someone who has always held the same belief. Why? Because a changed opinion suggests a willingness to question assumptions, consider new evidence, and adapt—a hallmark of open-mindedness.

When applying this approach to Bitcoin, I’ve made a curious observation: it’s remarkably difficult to find someone who was once pro-Bitcoin and is now against it. On the other hand, it’s incredibly easy to find people who were initially skeptical or even strongly opposed to Bitcoin but have since changed their minds.

This realization has shaped my own perspective. While I remain open to learning more, I can’t ignore the asymmetry here. If people are overwhelmingly moving toward Bitcoin after careful consideration, but very few (if any) are moving away from it, it raises important questions about the underlying value and potential of this technology.

To me, this pattern speaks volumes. It’s not about jumping on a bandwagon or blindly following trends. It’s about recognizing the power of changed opinions as a signal of something worth investigating further.";samcornwell;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gwbgf8/the_value_of_changed_opinions_a_reflection_on/;5;4.0;2024-11-21;08:17:30;Post;"The Value of Changed Opinions: A Reflection on Bitcoin

New to Bitcoin? Feel like you missed the boat? You're still quite early.;"For newcomers to Bitcoin that feel like they missed the boat or anyone in general for that matter, please read!!!!

I discovered Bitcoin accidentally in 2017, it was at a new all time high and everyone I talked to irl told me I was nuts to consider buying some at the outrageous price of $2000, they told me it had already made it's massive run up and was going to crash soon.

Despite all the warnings and mockery I pulled the trigger and my first $500 purchase got me 0.25 BTC.
At current prices my first ever $500 purchase is now worth over $23k!

Unfortunately I still felt like I had missed the boat so I started buying up ""Alt"" coins as well. 
It took me the better part of a full cycle studying Bitcoin before I dumped all of my shitcoins for more Bitcoin.

Don't waste your time on shitcoins and the promise of overnight wealth like I initially did, don't try to time the market, don't panic sell dips, if I had just focused on Bitcoin my first cycle I'd be retired already.

Yes $90k+ seems pricey, but Bitcoin has 1000x more going for it now then it did when I first started buying it, and in several years you'll look back and wish you had bought more at today's current prices.

YOU ARE STILL EXTREMELY EARLY!!!
I cannot state this enough, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Buy what you can afford too every week, $5, $20, $50, $100 etc. it all adds up over time and your future self will thank you greatly.

When in doubt, zoom out, I wish I had back in 2017, but I'm forever thankful that I ignored all the bad advice I received from some really smart people that simply hadn't taken the time to study Bitcoin.

$100k per Bitcoin is chump change, the real fun begins when we breach $1 million and the world will realize just how undervalued Bitcoin was at $100k.

How would putting a 100 dollars benefit me though? 
Or is it rather putting small amounts of money in continuously? 
I know if I put 100$ in when it is 100k, then at 1 mill it becomes 1000$, but it is not that much. 

I have been thinking the method of investing, since the way I see it from you guys is you just put money in, but it's not like it gives you dividends, so the money has to continuously sit there. So if I want to reach 1 bitcoin, first I don't see how I could with small amounts of money, and second the total amount of money I have to put in is still very large. 

So is it just continuously pumping money into it and never touching that money? Or are there strategies on how to continuously make money from it that I can go and learn?

How does this work?;"I put in $5,000 overall and am $3,000 up. I think it’ll go up to 100,000 then fall back to 60,000. 

Are there drawbacks to sell and cash out the $3,000 until it goes back down and then buy back at 60,000?

I know it can keep going up and my thinking maybe completely wrong.

;"If I wanted to try my hand at timing the market, **now doesn't seem like the time**. Bitcoin follows fairly predictable four-year cycles, and we should have about 1 year of gains ahead of us before the big, scary drop. If it were me, I would **sell about 1 year from now** and then **re-buy about 1 year before the next Halving**. 

Since its not really possible to predict the exact moment of the drop, I would maybe even **DCA out every month** next year instead of flirting with the exact moment of catastrophe.

But that's all hypothetical. In practice, I've been holding since 2013, through every up and down, and HODL has been a very successful strategy for me. If you have patience that spans decades, you don't need to time the market.

Is the mass adoption of Bitcoin actually a good thing?;"Throw away acc.


To be clear and to start, I'm not a bitcoin guru. I know very little about crypto currencies and the technology it possesses. But I do know this, bitcoin was created for the people, the mass majority of people. 


I've seen quite a bit of talk about the institutional investing and the adoption of bitcoin from particularly the US government. My question is, is this truly a good thing? For all of you hodlers who scream to never sell do you truly trust the process? It seems the government and institutional investors do everything they can to push down retail investors or make it more difficult for us to gain any sort of power. We've seen so much nonsense in these last 4 years since covid that extends far past investing.


I for one, do not believe in them, or trust them.



That being said, HODL, for now...

To be clear and to start, I'm not a bitcoin guru. I know very little about crypto currencies and the technology it possesses. But I do know this, bitcoin was created for the people, the mass majority of people.

I think a deflationary currency has the potential to very much slow the economy and devastate many industries, because the economy currently depends totally on 'growth', and inflation encourages spending to the point where many industries wouldn't survive without it.

;From my understanding, it’s because of the slow organic growth that occurred for bitcoin. Coins now a days can be manipulated by whale buying large quantities of coins that still have a small market cap. Because of crypto awareness and funds now exploiting the crypto markets to their advantage, slow organic growth for another coin where no player takes control of a large position is almost impossible. This in turn undermines confidence in other coins and limit their mass adoption.;No_Enthusiasm_4185;;2;0.0;2024-11-21;03:51:23;Comment; From my understanding, it’s because of the slow organic growth that occurred for bitcoin.

;"I think a rational investor can look at the previous bull/bear markets as being how a market behaves when it is largely driven by retail investors and tracked the four year halving cycle.

- Derivatives - access to massive capital markets and ability for big players to hedge positions (giving them the confidence to work with this asset)
- companies, pension funds adding it as a treasury asset
- US states adding it to their treasury
- nation states adding it to their strategic reserves - read that again… nation states. All wanting to acquire a scarce resource. Game theory at geopolitical scales!

Looking For Some Advice, If you guys don't mind.;"I recently started buying btc (around 2 months ago). I'm not at a financial point to put thousands of dollars in at once or even hundreds of dollars monthly. Currently I only have $730 in btc with $530 of that being money invested. I have an auto invest setup to buy $10 a week. All of this is done through cashapp for the time being. I also Have a high yield savings account through paypal that is holding a little over $1900 in it. 

Now for the advice questions,

First off what are your suggestions for a safer means of buying and storing my btc. I have been researching on how to run a node and how to go about storing my own keys but at this point I still dont understand the whole process. I've  seen people say that you download the node, then you download another program that is for verifying keys, then you have to find trusted people that post information to verify with to use in said program to make sure you downloaded a verified node. Then I've seen people say that all you have to do is download the node and you're good to go. The main questions I have about the node is how do I sync my btc with it? Can I buy straight from the program? Can I track btc prices from the program?

Any way back to the point of being here,

Should I pull the money from the savings acct and throw it into btc or should I leave it there and let it continue to slowly build? By slowly I mean since Jan of this year I have only gained $104 in interest. I know btc isn't a get rich quick deal, I know its a long term investment.  

By paying attn to what some of you guys have said I have convinced myself that there is something here to the point I have been kicking myself in the ass for not being smart enough to have thrown something as small as $100 in a few years ago.  I bought my son $100 worth the other day just so he would have a little skin in the game because I don't want him to miss out like I did. 

What are you guys thoughts?

I have been researching on how to run a node and how to go about storing my own keys but at this point I still dont understand the whole process. I've  seen people say that you download the node, then you download another program that is for verifying keys, then you have to find trusted people that post information to verify with to use in said program to make sure you downloaded a verified node. Then I've seen people say that all you have to do is download the node and you're good to go. The main questions I have about the node is how do I sync my btc with it? Can I buy straight from the program? Can I track btc prices from the program?

Any way back to the point of being here,

Should I pull the money from the savings acct and throw it into btc or should I leave it there and let it continue to slowly build? By slowly I mean since Jan of this year I have only gained $104 in interest. I know btc isn't a get rich quick deal, I know its a long term investment.  

By paying attn to what some of you guys have said I have convinced myself that there is something here to the point I have been kicking myself in the ass for not being smart enough to have thrown something as small as $100 in a few years ago.  I bought my son $100 worth the other day just so he would have a little skin in the game because I don't want him to miss out like I did. 

What are you guys thoughts?

My Bitcoin Savior Complex;"Last year, when the price of Bitcoin was around 25k per coin, a good friend of mine told me I had to snap out of this and get out now if it’s high. Another friend of mine said that ""people like me"" don’t know how research is done. Another ""friend"" of mine actually called me on Messenger to make sure my Facebook account wasn’t hacked, then told me Bitcoin was a joke. What a slap in the face. I'm not laughing.

It's a shame how Bitcoin has become a partisan issue. It's a shame that people think Crypto and Bitcoin are the same thing. And it's a damn shame that we have discovered perfect money that can solve most of the world's problems, but no one will listen.

I now know why OG Bitcoiners don't spread the sound money gospel to their friends and family. They respond with ridicule, gaslighting tactics, and jealousy. They have to learn the hard way to shut up and let people find out on their own. Some people will never learn, and it's not for lack of intelligence. Their egos are the culprit in this tragic tale. 

I do want the people I care about to escape the fiat matrix. Unfortunately, it is not our job to save anyone, and sometimes you just have to plant the seed and move on, hoping that it takes root and they find financial sovereignty.

* Dilution - okay now our premium on ""bitcoin"" varies based on future ATM raises at the whim of just Saylor or the board.  This in theory fuels the unstoppable machine of converting dollars in bitcoin
* Biggest red flag - investor are not entitled to the underlying; the actual bitcoin

So if Saylor's bull thesis is correct, investors are literally fueling the destruction of their own currency to help push bitcoin towards the paradigm shift that is the new reserve currency.

At the end of the day, investors don't actually own over-priced bitcoin.  Investors can only sell for dollars.  If Saylor's bull thesis is ""Bitcoin to $13 million"" then that implies the death of the dollar.  Investors are just lighting their cash on fire.

Why this is amazing?

You have people shoveling cash/fiat/dollars in the Bitcoin furnace, accelerating the price rise of bitcoin, assisting in the death of the very currency their investment is denoted in.  Cashing out MSTR when bitcoin hits $13 million will be no different then transferring current dollars to Brazilian Bolivars or Zimbabwe dollars.

Why this is amazing?

You have people shoveling cash/fiat/dollars in the Bitcoin furnace, accelerating the price rise of bitcoin, assisting in the death of the very currency their investment is denoted in.  Cashing out MSTR when bitcoin hits $13 million will be no different then transferring current dollars to Brazilian Bolivars or Zimbabwe dollars.  

Invest dollars to aid in bitcoin appreciation and dollar destruction.  Only investment where price appreciation in the stock means you're actually losing money in the end game."
;"Their thesis is that they are taking on debt in USD to buy BTC, with very low interest rates, thus increasing their asset value relative to loan. They make small fractional withdrawals to cover the interest and take the rest of the profit.

People are actually on board with this and are funneling money in the form of bonds to finance further buying.

This drives the price of BTC up relative to USD.

;"The dollar is being destroyed by over printing anyway, which is ""inflation"". The typical issue is that no other currency is stable or broad enough to devalue the US dollar globally. 

This is the case for BTC since the dollar is no longer tied to a commodity; which comes from somewhere and is thus scarce. 

Well, some ""safe"" investor could get their bond premiums and be happy. Or, given their **bonds are convertable to stock, the bonds are actually increasing in value. Likewise, if MSTR goes down, they get their bond payment. If MSTR goes up, they could still collect their bond, convert to stock, or simply sell the bond.

And I know that nobody can actually know for a fact whether the value of Bitcoin would go up, or down. But based on the past, and some analysis, its value is predicted to be around $1M around 2030. Who knows, maybe if I start DCAing from now alongside my initial investment, hopefully I can retire early.

I'm basically new to all this crypto ecosystem; but still, there are some really interesting stories out there from people who became so rich because of it; and that, it's really hard to ignore...

I Will Not Sell My Bitcoin (A playful parody of Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham) - Poem below;"I will not sell it in a dip,
I will not sell it on a blip.
I will not sell it here or there,
I will not sell it anywhere.

I will not sell it when it's low,
I will not sell it when it grows.
I will not sell it, not for gold,
For Bitcoin's value can't be told.

Would you sell it for a yacht?
Would you sell it for a lot?

Not for a yacht, not for a lot.
Not even if the price gets hot.
I will not sell my Bitcoin, man.
I hodl tightly, that's my plan.

What about when markets crash?
Would you sell it for some cash?

Not for cash and not for stocks,
Not for mansions, boats, or clocks.
I will not sell it here or there,
I will not sell it anywhere!

Why so stubborn? Why so sure?
Won't you fold and sell, monsieur?

No, I will not sell, you see,
Bitcoin holds my sovereignty.
With every block, my wealth is mine,
Secure, unseized, across all time.

So ask me once, or ask me twice,
No amount will match the price.
I will not sell it, not for fun.
Bitcoin's race has just begun!

UTXO management ;"I buy BTC by bank transfer. Basically any transfer I make is converted into BTC and sent to the public address I indicated.
Assuming that I use the same public address several times in a row, does that mean it accumulates as one unique UTXO ?

I don't fully understand the concept of UTXO, if someone could please clarify.

Like, let's say I have an address and I consider two scenarios: 
- First scenario: I get 0.1 BTC sent to that address once.
- Second scenario: I get 0.01 BTC sent to that address 10 times.

A few years later, I send those 0.1 BTC to someone's address in one unique transaction to exchange to fiat. Is there a scenario where I have to pay more to the miner, or are these scenarios equivalent?

;"No it doesn't combine. Each individual ""deposit"" is a separate UTXO, into one address or into many. So reusing addresses has no benefit in terms of UTXOs. 

Each UTXO, in the same address or many addresses will need to be signed when you spend it. i.e. to spend 11 UTXOs you need 11 signatures and that increases data size of the spending transaction. So your transaction fee will be higher. 

Don't reuse addresses for UTXO reasons, that does nothing for that. But you can reuse addresses for convenience, that's also fine but not recommended.

Assuming fees are low you want to spend 11 UTXOs at once it will cost you 2 or 3 sats per byte with each being few hundred bytes. If fees spike to say 20 or 30 sats per byte the fee you'd have to pay to miners would be 10 times higher. So you can see how taking your 11 UTXOs and spending them into 1 at 2 sats/byte is beneficial to you when you have to spend 1 UTXO at some point later and the fees are 50 or 100 sats per byte. i.e. you don't have to combine 11 at high rates under pressure, if you consolidate them into 1 during low fee times.";SmoothGoing;;2;0.0;2024-11-21;00:52:12;Comment;" No it doesn't combine.

;"for reals, that CO2 claim came out of nowhere

Initially I also was shocked when I learned that the throughput rate was so low. But if the transactions are extradoinarily large between major entities, and any details are covered in some L2 roll ups (assuming I understand those correctly), then it is not as major of an issue.

It does make us extremely reliant on the internet. Which is already a reality to some degree.

What always makes me wonder though, is why bitcoin vs anyyyy other coin. Or even, and I have no idea if this is possible. A full reset, and then it be a true gold rush.

The two main questions you have to ask yourself: can you stomach a drop down 10%, 20%, 30% or something like that the day after you bought?

If the answer to both question is a yes, then you might consider lump sum. Either way, it doesn't really matter that much.  

One argument in favour of DCA beyond pure EV is that it gives you a bit of time to get accustomed to bitcoin storage/transactions before jumping in with larger amounts.

;"For those who smile this away as gimmic let me explain.

It balances very quickly ones personal financial position and both their risk level and gratification needs.

If a halving of the money you put in doesn't trigger you there is clearly enough financial room to invest more.
As when you would panic or worse you have invested to much.

On the upsite if a doubling doesn't effect you at all you don't trigger your gratification level. Probably due to your financial position being so good it doesn't matter and than you should invest more.
Also take into account that a doubling in traditional investments could easily take 5 to 10 years, so it should do something to you.
If a doubling would scare the hell out of you it is fair to assume you invested too much.

With most people these factors are connected and form a balance at some point.
If not their risk level could be unconventional, or expectations way out of line, also a gambler has an offset that is not healthy and will lead to problems.

;"Assuming Bitcoin becomes the next global reserve asset, There are 5.5 billion people in the world as of October 2024 with internet access.

Is this Hardware Wallet safe?;"Hi there,

I am wondering if it is safe to use this device. I recently received a Bitbox and it was completely opened. The security package was opened, the box inside was opened. I purchased direct from the company but it is the issue around international customs opening it. They would have ripped it open to see the contents of the package. I didn't think they would need to open the security packaging as I would have thought they would have just ran it through some sort of x-ray device. I know in this instance, it is not the fault of the company. 

I feel unsafe using the wallet now as I feel it could have easily been tampered with at international customs and someone there could have easily done something to it (I am not a software engineer or coder but I have seen what people are capable of doing nowadays with tech) 

Is there any way to check if the device is tampered with and someone has put in there own crypto address in there and when they see funds be able to steal all of it. I'm looking at worst case scenario as this just does not feel safe at all.

I will be raising this with Bitbox directly via their online channels as well

NOTE: Bitbox received and obvious it is completely ripped open from international customs, is it safe at all to use? What can a hacker or someone who got access to the device be able to do?

Coinbase advanced vs Strike ;"Has anybody thought that which platform is better for DCA Bitcoin? I saw some posts said that Strike has better DCA than Coinbase Ad but why I see that coinbase Ad has better fee with DCA. 

I agree that Strike will have no fee recurring purchase after 1 week, but it has 1% spread

Coinbase Ad, I buy BTC with order type market which means buy with current price that BTC has and no spread at all, but with fee purchase ( 0.75% taker) 

For withdrawal, Strike definitely has no fee with withdrawing in 24 hrs. But coinbase Ad has just a little fee withdrawal below $1.

Retail FOMO happens after Thanksgiving holiday ;"Retail hasn't really come into the market.

Even looking at sentiment indicators like Google searches shows that bitcoin is not on the minds of the broader public.

Thanksgiving ""could"" be the time where that crazy relative that's been screaming about bitcoin actually feels vindicated and people listen.

There's also just more time for people to relax and do their own research.

I think this Thanksgiving is when retail finally wakes up.

;"1.  They announced a debt offering of $1.75b.  However, the market REALLY liked it so it increased to $2.6B.  Of that, $400m was bought by the investment banks running the deal.

2.  Zero percent means MSTR pays no interest on the bonds.  Why would someone buy these?  because they convert to MSTR.

3.  55% conversion premium means this.  If the bonds were sold when MSTR was at $400 per share, then theoretically a $1,000 face bond would convert to ($1,000/$400) 2.5 MSTR shares.  A 55% conversion premium means they convert to ($1,000/($400\*1.55) 1.6 shares.  So there is significantly less dilution.

4.  To put this in context, a typical convertible bond pays interest of 2%-3% and converts at a 30% premium.  MSTR is very volatile and that makes the conversion option embedded in the bond very valuable.  Valuable enough for investors to want the bond even though it doesn't pay interest and even though the stock price has to rise 55% before the conversion feature is in the money.

Thoughts about environmental concern;"Hi all. Please don't troll I'm just looking for opinions & information.


Long time holder but one thing that
always concerned me is (here we go again) bitcoin's environmental impact. Doing my own research and here is my thought process:


I acknowledge miners have an interest favoring renewables & otherwise wasted energy. In that bitcoin can indirectly help develop new forms of energy, granted. But this energy could be used elsewhere. To me there is no arguing bitcoin's direct impact on environment is strongly negative - I mean the PoW requires using machine power to solve randomly generated problems in a period where we need to limit our energy consumption, that enough should close the debate.


Now, does it mean bitcoin should not exist ? Probably not. Otherwise let's ban chatbots, christmas lights, etc etc. Even traditional banking as a whole might be more energy intensive, and that creates a potential positive indirect impact if it were to adopt bitcoin at its core. 


I can wrap my head around this idea but I'd love to hear constructive thoughts, research material or reading recommendations. In particular I'm wondering if second layer developments like lightning would have an impact on bitcoin's energy consumption ? Or if any future implementations to tackle this problem are being explored (obviously ignoring the absurdity of switching to PoS that defeats the whole purpose).


Bottomline: yes other sectors are worse. But how can we do better ? Looking to open the debate and see if others share this concern of bitcoin already ranking among the top polluting countries.";Upper-Researcher-126;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gvoztr/thoughts_about_environmental_concern/;3;36.0;2024-11-20;13:03:12;Post;"Thoughts about environmental concern Hi all.

;"I'm a big environmentalist, but am also pro-bitcoin.

I think climate change is one of the biggest issues facing humanity. I am going to take a different approach to explaining my position on bitcoin aside from the usual takes that it promotes renewable energy use (which is largely true).

So with that said, here is why I am pro-bitcoin. Yes, bitcoin uses a lot of energy today. A vast majority of that energy is spent on the production of bitcoin. If you look at any given block, you see that most of the incentive comes from the block subsidy (3.125 BTC). Only a small portion of the block rewards come from fees.

That means that the energy being spent today and largely up until this point in time has been for the purpose of bringing new bitcoin into circulation. Obviously we all know that this block reward gets cut in half roughly every 4 years. That means that it is inevitable that bitcoin shifts from energy being spent primarily to bring bitcoin into circulation to energy being spent to facilitate economic transactions.

This is important to understand.

What does this mean from an environmental perspective? Bitcoin is a digital commodity. That means that it can be infinitely reused. The bitcoin I transact with today can be transacted with 200 years from now by my descendants. When we talk about sustainability, reuseability is at the core of it. If bitcoin is worth millions some day, how many commodities can you think of can say are something that is worth millions, but were brought into circulation for today's and yesterday's energy cost? In other words, you're bringing something into existence that is potentially worth millions of dollars that can be infinitely reused for a cost of say $10k in today's energy prices.

Now let's talk about the decreasing block subsidy. Since it decreases in half every 4 years, it is inevitable that the primary driver of energy costs will be transaction fees rather than the production of new bitcoin. There is almost zero overhead when it comes to bitcoin mining. A vast majority of the cost to mining over the long term is energy. That means that if you pay $100 in transaction fees to confirm a transaction with bitcoin, that is almost exactly what the cost in energy would be to have it confirmed. That is extremely efficient when it comes to energy efficiency for a monetary transaction. Combine that with the fact that on-chain transactions will largely be settlements for hundreds/thousands of L2 transactions and you have a monetary system that is extremely energy efficient.

Also, bitcoin's supply schedule can't be changed. Our current central banking monetary system is all about expanding the GDP at all costs. This is extremely unsustainable in the sense that it doesn't care at what costs to the environment the GDP grows, as long as we print more money to allow for that growth, all is well. Without the money printer in bitcoin, growth for our economy will be more deliberate and promote saving. Because saving money will be a bigger part of the economy in a bitcoin standard, it means that there will be less consumerist tendencies throughout the economy. Everything we produce has a carbon footprint, there is no way around that fact. So the less consumerist/materialistic our economy is, the better.

Finally, I'll add that because bitcoin is decentralized and a bearer asset, you don't have to worry about your deposits being used to finance fossil fuel companies or other anti-environmental pursuits. The financial industry and central banking are huge contributors to fossil fuel companies via both lending and subsidies.

TLDR: bitcoin is an infinitely reusable sustainable monetary system that will be extremely energy efficient in the future when it transitions to a fee based system. Either it continues to see adoption and becomes the financial system it promises to be and therefore justifies its energy costs, or it fails to do so and its stops consuming energy.";lifeanon269;;3;0.0;2024-11-20;14:01:45;Comment;" I'm a big environmentalist, but am also pro-bitcoin.

MSTR: a threat to BTC?;Just looking for some thoughts here. Saylor and MSTR have obviously done a lot to promote Bitcoin and I think they've so far been a huge net good. However, MSTR is taking on a lot of debt to buy BTC and if BTC ever experiences a large dip, they might have trouble paying back those loans, making them forced sellers.

Just looking for some thoughts here. Saylor and MSTR have obviously done a lot to promote Bitcoin and I think they've so far been a huge net good. However, MSTR is taking on a lot of debt to buy BTC and if BTC ever experiences a large dip, they might have trouble paying back those loans, making them forced sellers. Obviously, there will be plenty of us picking up the cheap sats, but the sheer wealth concentration doesn't sit entirely right with me. Does anyone else have concerns about this?

;Bitcoin does not solve for wealth disparity. It solves for money debasement. Those who stacked large and early will have concentrated wealth. But anyone who stacks, including low wage earners and even the poor, no matter how small their stack, can preserve their savings for a better future. In the fiat system, the poor cannot save their way out of poverty because inflation increases faster than their savings. It’s a trap.

Question about the selling transaction speeds;Can someone explain the process but more specifically the speed I can expect, should I decide to sell if there is a significant pull back, what that process looks like and at what speed it happens. I would need to move from hot wallet to Coinbase, then Coinbase to USD. Coinbase is saying 35 minutes to receive bitcoin. After that how long does it take to switch to USD? And at what point/price does it exchange at? Is there a slide as the price fluctuates until the moment it exchanges? Does the amount make a difference? Does it help to go ahead and upgrade Coinbase One to not get the account locked while they do all their checking? Thanks for any info. I am so stoked about this.

Question from a non holder.;"So obviously and firstly : congrats micro strategy-ers! What a run you are seeing. 
I hold Bitcoin and have done since 2017 so we are somewhat in the same boat with regards to the upside we are seeing, I wanted to ask : moving forward Saylor talks about yield though there is none currently other than money flowing in via shares bought, do we expect to see a point where central banks will pay a yield against his Bitcoin if he loans them out or something similar? 

Essentially : moving forward how does he (and by proxy people like me) generate yield from our coins without selling? 

Thanks 🙏🏼 ";NotCoolFool;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gvmwg5/question_from_a_non_holder/;0;6.0;2024-11-20;10:58:59;Post;"Question from a non holder. So obviously and firstly : congrats micro strategy-ers! What a run you are seeing.

Seems we've established our narrative for the 2025 bull market;"I'm entering my third cycle and reflecting back I recognise there were bullish narratives that fuelled the frothy positive sentiment characteristic of Bitcoin bull markets. I'm struggling to recall entirely but from memory:

In 2017, it was futures approvals at CBOE and CME, altcoin/ICO boom and institutions are coming.

In 2021, it was retail trading via PayPal, CashApp, Robinhood, institutional adoption by Microstrategy and Tesla, Grayscale NAV discount trade and excessive COVID money printing.

In 2025, it's seemingly US strategic Bitcoin reserve, nation state adoption, Microstrategy reflexive loop, ETFs, ETF options and the perennial institutions are coming.

From experience, I'd be cautious of placing too much expectation on these narratives in the short term, but they definitely do drive and sustain the vitality of the bull markets.

Can someone explain the MSTR premium?;"I saw this Saylor interview yesterday, probably from a X space, where he explained in the clearest terms what MSTR is doing, that it's building a treasury, giving purchasers of his fixed-income products preferred access to the market, essentially transferring the risk away from them. And he was talking about the value premium that MSTR creates on top of Bitcoin.

For now I’m just trying to fully understand what’s happening here, so if anyone feels like adding to the above explanation, please feel free.

I’m slowly starting to understand how that’s an attack on the stock market and anyone with an understanding of it must naturally feel compelled to participate in it.

**Here’s my question:** The value that MSTR creates on top of Bitcoin by building a treasury around it and marketing products, can anyone *quantify* that premium?

Like, holding Bitcoin >1y is tax-free in my country, while buying and later selling MSTR (obviously in order to by real BTC) will always cost me a fixed 25% capital gains tax, so MSTR’s premium needs to be consistently above 25% to even make sense for many people over holding BTC.

My technological knowledge about Bitcoin is shallow, but here is what I understand;"- Bitcoin has gold-like properties which are expected from a potential store of value. It's rare, but not too rare to be practical, it does not spoil, it's divisible, easy to measure and easy to store and transport. It also adds some new useful properties such as decentralization and is built on zero trust principles.
- It is the first thing humanity created that a) has the aforementioned qualities and b) caught on and c) is guaranteed to have a fixed  supply, forever. We can find more gold in space. We can make beachfront property. But in 10000 years there will still be only 21 million Bitcoin.
- It cannot be recreated. There cannot be another first. Psychology and the network effect are real.

This means that Bitcoin will become a black hole that sucks up massive amounts of capital from non fixed supply sources.

- Tech is discovered that cracks state of the art encryption without enough time to react. In that case everything is fucked, not just Bitcoin.

;"Nearly 20 million have been mined, we'll reach this number pretty soon. That last million will take 100 years.

Every single Bitcoin mined is held by someone and is accounted for, none are just sitting in the wild. This means the price is determined at the margin, which usually is around 3/10 people who hold Bitcoin are determining how high the price goes as the other 7/10 mostly just sit there or wait a long time to sell a portion of their bags.

No one knows how many are lost but most people think it is around 4-5 million. This number isn't completely arbitrary as there has been a fair amount of research but it could still be drastically off. Either way more and more Bitcoin will be lost as the years go by. 

The amount of Bitcoin on exchanges isn't the best metric either, because it is easy to move coins off and onto exchanges in minutes. However, the metric is good for market sentiment. Right now there are less than 2.3 million Bitcoin on exchanges, and the number is still going down. This is a new trend. Usually during bull markets more Bitcoin flows into exchanges but they are still flowing out. And, currently we're at levels not seen since 2 cycles ago back in 2016-2018. 

The number of Bitcoin, 21 million, won't change. The decimal location is something that could change in the future, but right now there's no point to alter that, and it would be very difficult to reach consensus. 

Bitcoin accrues value based on network effect, meaning any use for it a person could have individually is likely to increase its value. Being finite this means Bitcoin will go up forever when valued in fiat currency.

You sometimes just think your own investment is not enough. If I’m going to be honest 1 BTC is not going to make you “rich” it’s going to be a great asset to hold and pass through generation for wealth. 

The real people that  will have wealth out of the multiple bitcoins they already have or are the ones scooping up large amounts of bitcoins now. It’s a different league out there are we may just be convincing ourselves otherwise with our small holdings.

As everyone says a whole coin is an arbitrary number. But what do you all think?"

;"Around 2012 one of my friend said his roommate and his buddies were solving math problems with their laptops to get a reward called bitcoin. It could be used as money.

I thought it was a scam/weird concept, kinda like a game with monopoly money.

Never heard of it again until around 2020 when Elon Musk started to tweet about crypto. I look at the price and graph of bitcoin and I felt like I had lost the opportunity of a lifetime. 

I started buying right away and I still DCA now.";SwordmanGuts;;2;0.0;2024-11-20;13:48:02;Comment;" Around 2012 one of my friend said his roommate and his buddies were solving math problems with their laptops to get a reward called bitcoin. It could be used as money.

Could Trump Be Crypto’s Secret Weapon? Banking Chokehold Might Loosen Soon;"Alright, so here’s the scoop: For the past couple of years, crypto’s been in a chokehold thanks to regulators making it nearly impossible to get bank accounts. Running a crypto company has been a nightmare—startups are waiting months to open accounts, some are even ditching the U.S. entirely.

But now, with Trump back, there’s some hope. He’s out here saying he’ll *“shut down Operation Choke Point 2.0”* and make the U.S. the *crypto capital of the world*. Even talking about firing Gensler and building a national Bitcoin reserve. Wild, right?

If Trump’s serious, we could see:

* Banks opening up to crypto companies again.
* Stablecoin issuers and exchanges finally getting the support they need.
* Fewer hoops to jump through for startups.

But let’s not get too hyped just yet:

* Big banks like JPMorgan probably still won’t touch crypto—too much risk.
* Smaller banks might step in, but past failures like Silvergate make it tricky.
* And Trump’s still got to deal with some regulators who aren’t exactly crypto fans.

When BTC hits $100k, it's 10 sats to a cent;"Cup of coffee? 5000 sats ($5)

A year of college? 50 million sats ($50k)

Buying a house? 250 million sats ($250k)

Except, the supply for these is limitless, while sats are limited (only 2.1 quadrillion or 2100 trillion will ever exist).

The next milestone here is 1 sat = 1 cent, when BTC hits USD 1 million. 

There's more than a few countries with currency currently valued at 1/100th of a USD. Talking sats, not coins, is what will normalize Bitcoin as a relatable store of value in everyday terms.

;"This is such a smart way to make Bitcoin relatable. Talking in sats instead of BTC makes it easier for people to connect—10 sats = 1 cent just clicks. A coffee for 5000 sats or a house for 250 million sats shows how scarce Bitcoin is compared to fiat.

Focusing on sats also makes Bitcoin accessible for people in countries with weaker currencies and normalizes it for everyday use. Most people don’t think in fractions of BTC, but sats feel practical.

I have no idea if it's better to purchase it all at once, and if so any advice on the most secure ways to perform a one time purchase vs spreading them out over time. I have a strong feeling I need to do this now, and I'm so grateful for any wisdom I can get. I so respect anyone who has been so brave so as to venture into this territory. Exciting times.

Step 2: Forget about it for the next 20 years. Your current self wishes your past self bought in sooner, but Your future self will thank you for buying today.

"""Bitcoin will unite a deeply divided country?""  Absolutely not!";"Someone posted this from Jack Dorsey.

My answer is ""absolutely not.""

Just because good things happen to a nation, that doesn't mean that everyone is satisfied.

Good morning.  You're a standard American who has saved his money in dollars.  You think bitcoin is a poor replacement and you don't want to buy it.

One month your bank account is worth 10% less every week because some businesses are demanding to be paid in bitcoin rather than dollars.  You don't get it and you're really angry.  You go and buy bitcoin but it never seems to be enough.

;"A lot of these investments are distorted due to the inflation pressure on fiat.

Especially the housing marked is a sample that is now used as saving account/investment while in fact it still loosing value over time (most houses won't last 100 years !), has high costs like maintenance, is taxed, etc etc. All because fiat is a lousy store of value !

Art, companies and the likes will aways hold value, but a part of current valuation is again due to fiat being a bad store of value.
Once Bitcoin is commonly accepted as store of value a lot of the value now stored in houses and other things will flow into Bitcoin.

Fiat has distorted so many things for so long most can't see it.
But when the superior store of value of Bitcoin becomes clear the turnaround will be way faster than most can imagine.

I expect a panic phase where in flows will be insane.
The mempool will be filled with high value transactions and fees will shock every normal user.
Don't even think you will be able to exit 1 Bitcoin fast onchain becourse it will be outbid by huge transactions.
Low fees time is when you prepare by sending some to lightning.

We will again hear Bitcoin can't work due to these high fees.
And it will stay that way for some time.

;"So lump sum versus DCA is generally the better option for investing. Basically, the lump sum gives you more time in the market, and time trumps most strategies. 

With Bitcoin this is even more true. I believe it's around 90% of the time lump sum beats DCA for BTC. 

However, some opinion time here. We are suddenly seeing a lot of movement with Bitcoin adoption and I think even the OG crowd is missing it.

DCA'ing 3 times per day.;"DCA'ing is a joy for me. I used to do it only once per day at a certain time by automating it but I said... Maybe I should spread up my buys.

So I started DCA'ing 3 times per day. 8 pm, 4 am and 12 pm. 11.92 (which is 11.11 dollars) each time after fees. I just want to keep it up regardless of the price.

;"Ok, so I did the calculations.

1 buy

 35.24−33.33= 1.91 in fees

3 small buys

11.92 - 11.11=0.81 in fees

0.81 x 3 = 2.43 per day

What would you do without Bitcoin?;Sorry, not one of your daily moon-boy posts here. If you live in Argentina, are fortunate enough to have some savings, and you have inflation of above 100% for multiple years, what would you do without Bitcoin? You don't have easy access to other currencies as the government controls the supply. There's a black market for $ but that means you'll pay way higher exchange rates than the official one. You could invest in stocks but their economy isn't really stable and return rates are not keeping up with inflation. Real estate is an alternative but that's illiquid. You only really have one option here and that is Bitcoin. And now imagine that the same goes for currently 28 countries with inflation above 10%. Ignoring anything else, like giving you the sovereignty over your own savings, just from a pure economical standpoint, there is no alternative to Bitcoin for a lot of people - and sooner or later everyone starts to realize that. ;Human-Key-7984;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gvdsy8/what_would_you_do_without_bitcoin/;3;3.0;2024-11-20;01:25:29;Post;What would you do without Bitcoin?

;"Been surfing in this game for over 10 years. I had a very tough time at first. Over time my silence in groups draws more bitcoin talk than if I bring it up. The circles around me seek me out for advice in that area at this point. 

The best practical advice I can give you is to study the history of money in chronological and reverse chronological order. Read some non bitcoin books such as “history of money”, just a bunch of nitty gritty history and raw details of how things went down. Study the different decades in closer detail around 1900-2024. Can you tell me what happened in every decade with money and how it did or didn’t affect the people’s lives of that time?

Eventually you find all the information possible from our history. You can identify the trends that have taken place over time. At this point you will have an answer to every Bitcoin criticism, but you must also be able to find the cons with Bitcoin. 

Telling people both the pros and cons of Bitcoin makes them think that you are considering all aspects better and you aren’t a “moon” boy. 

You will eventually get to a point where you can have a peaceful conversation about every technical aspect of money starting at 10,000BC-2024 and discuss the pros and cons of different periods and how the people responded. 

If you just reason with people and don’t hype things up you can help guide them to the answer by showing them facts about how it is a superior option amongst a sea of bad options

;Bitcoin has an impact on greed as well.   As the economy becomes based on Bitcoin as a store of value, the system won't allow the creation of money for nothing.  You'll need to exchange value for value going forward.

Microstrategy is bad for bitcoin ;"I love michael saylor. He is right in actually everything he speaks about bitcoin etc. And I think he found the infinitve money glitch with bitcoin strategy at Microstrategy. He has found the way to streamline infinitive central bank money through intelligent leverage and with his company to go into bitcoin.
This idea is so good. It has also some positive side effects. E.g it will reduce down side price risk by his commitment to continue to buy bitcoin. If vola for bitcoin gets smaller he will get better interest rates. The amount of capital he can use will continue to grow and therefore the price will rise. Rinse and repeat. 

BUT: There will be an end for this strategy. Governments cannot control Bitcoin. But they can control and regulate companies. And they will. United States will actually have to intervene in any way and stop this. 

I hate to say this but I think this will be the next FTX Moment in this cycle (or next).

;"This is the biggest question I have. I think question is healthy, and discussing scenarios is good. Whats been goin thru my mind is liek okay so all the billionaires are buying all the bitcoin.... and this will make bitcoins price eventually be over 13milion per coin.... So these billionairs could i guess multiply billions by millions and get trillions, to pay off americas debt i guess? 

  
I do BELIEVE in bitcoin, as history shows it has cycles that pop off of course. Well what happens if it does crash 50%? With everything going on, idk if crashing that hard is possible, and others have raised the question as well. Perhaps less crash, maybe 20%? Time will tell.

Creating your own key + password;"I've seen a few posts written on this topic over the years. I am personally inclined to create my own private key (24 words) + password so I can better remember it. I have a new hardware wallet, but it remains untouched because I am currently torn on whether to have the wallet generate a random private key or whether to use one I have made myself. 

I have it written down, and basically have it memorized. I know it is not completely random (Some words flow in my mind from one to another. For example, woodpecker & twig), but it is far more random than many of the examples given in other posts, such as someone who used the lyrics of a song or a page in a book or the words of a speech. Perhaps one could liken the phrase I jotted down to an incoherent dream.

I also recently read that you can now create a password that is part of your private key, like an  extra special 25th word. That seems to me to be sufficient.  Does someone know they've discovered a wallet with the 24 words, or do they need all 25 to know that they've identified a constellation of words that belongs to someone else?

There seem to be competing risks. On the one hand, having a perfectly random seed phrase generated offline leaves you open to the risk that, if you lose a physical copy of your key, you're less likely to remember the seed phrase. On the other, creating an imperfectly random seed phrase makes it more likely that someone else could crack your seed phrase.

Any words of advice, your perspectives, or your experiences would be welcome as I continue to mull this over.

;Don't do it;Aussiehash;;3;0.0;2024-11-19;21:41:18;Comment; Don't do it
;"creating your own passphrase is fine, do it

creating your own seed phrase is an incredibly stupid thing to do

nobody will 'stumble' upon your 24 word seed phrase by accident, the mathematical probabilities of that are so near zero that they can be assumed as zero

but, if they did, and you had a passphrase, they'd see a wallet with a zero balance

you can use as many passphrases on top of your seed mnemonic as you want and every single one of them goes to an entirely different wallet

using a passphrase also allows you to keep a second or third backup of your mnemonic with a trusted friend or family member, without the passphrase they can't access your coin

the passphrase can be safely stored in a password manager


--------

back to mathematical probabilities

for now, let's just focus on 12-word seed phrases

there are 2048^12 or 2^132 possible 12-word seed phrase combinations (because the [dictionary of BIP39 seed words](https://www.blockplate.com/pages/bip-39-wordlist) contains 2048 words - you can't just use any word you want)

that's 5.4445179e+39, or five duodecillion four hundred forty-four undecillion five hundred seventeen decillion nine hundred nonillion different 12-word combinations

let's be incredibly generous and assume a bad actor can make 1 billion guesses per second, then it would only take you 1.7252636e+23 years to guess a 12-word mnemonic 

that's one hundred seventy-two sextillion five hundred twenty-six quintillion three hundred sixty quadrillion years 

I can't even fathom a number that large, can you? 

all I know is it's a hell of a lot larger than 6 billion, and in 6 billion years, the sun dies and destroys the earth - so I'd say you're pretty safe

--------

if you're super paranoid about your seed phrase being discovered, you can keep a 'dummy' balance in the un-passphrased wallet and monitor if the coin ever moves -- if it does, you'll have ample time to move the passphrased coin to a new wallet with a new mnemonic before the passphrase could possibly be bruteforced

--------

if you still don't trust your wallet to adequately generate a random seed for you, you can [roll your own](https://bitbox.swiss/blog/roll-the-dice-generate-your-own-seed/)

but I guarantee you that any reputable hardware wallet is going to do a better job of giving you a random seed than any 'random' one you could come up with in your head

you're also vastly underestimating your ability to simply memorize 12-24 words - regardless of how they were generated

have you ever memorized the lyrics to a song by heart? that's a lot more than 24 words

Self-custody wallet recommendations?;"Hi everyone, 

I've been stopping by on this sub, on and off since 2013, but decided this week to start posting more actively and under an account linked to my real name.

I'd love to get some feedback on which self-custody wallets you guys recommend to family and friends. I've always recommended hardware wallets, but they can definitely be challenging to use for many people and securely backing up your seed phrase is a big responsibility that can be stressful and difficult to do correctly.

You need to think about exactly where that interest comes from. 

It usually comes from lending ""your"" bitcoin to others. What happens if the borrowers are unable to pay it back? what happens if we hit some kind of economic downturn and bankruptcies skyrocket?

If you're looking for a good interest rate on ""your"" BTC, maybe you should consider *Gemini Earn* or *Celsius Network* instead.

Oh wait... you can't because they both collapsed and took customer funds with them when things got challenging:

;"Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

;"Not a soul can answer this question for you unfortunately because it essentially comes down to your personal risk appetite and your financial goals.

Traditional advice would be of course take some off the table especially after 140% increase. But as we all know btc is not a traditional investment. It has the potential to radically increase in price over next 10 years. At the same time, while I don’t think it would go to zero as some speculate is the worst case scenario,  it could crash and never rebound as it has over past cycles. It depends on status of the world geo-politically, whether btc successfully decouples from the stock market/real economy (ie can it thrive through a deep recession, depression or some other financial crisis?) and the extent to which it reaches the vaunted digital gold position as opposed to being merely a narrative. I don’t have a crystal ball but I’m willing to bet 93k isn’t the forever top in the medium term at least.

Now having said all this I have used some of my btc over the years to fund things such as a house deposit/pay off student loans because I have one life to live and I’m not staking everything on btc. Btc can and has helped me reach some of my financial goals and the past sales help me be more financially sound now and sleep easier at night. I still have significant exposure to btc as a % of my investments so I feel this has been a good balance.

If btc goes to x million I don’t think I’ll ever feel upset at my past self for selling. The future is unknowable. I may be dead before btc makes certain numbers and one must make choices based on the data available to them at the time and what they want from life.

;"BITO, or the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, tracks Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures contracts rather than holding Bitcoin directly. Here’s how it works:

1. Bitcoin Futures Contracts

	•	BITO primarily holds Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
	•	These are agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a future date for a predetermined price.
	•	Futures contracts allow BITO to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning actual Bitcoin.

2. Price Correlation

	•	The ETF aims to closely track the performance of the Bitcoin futures market, which often correlates with Bitcoin’s spot price.
	•	However, due to factors like contango (when future prices are higher than spot prices) or backwardation (when they’re lower), the ETF may not perfectly match Bitcoin’s spot price.

3. Rolling Contracts

	•	Futures contracts have expiration dates, so BITO must roll contracts—sell expiring contracts and buy new ones—periodically.
	•	This process can create additional costs or slippage, potentially causing slight differences between BITO’s performance and Bitcoin’s spot price.

4. Cash Holdings and Collateral

	•	BITO keeps a portion of its assets in cash or cash equivalents (e.g., Treasury bills) as collateral for the futures contracts.
	•	This helps manage liquidity and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.

5. Regulation and Transparency

	•	BITO is regulated by the SEC and offers investors exposure to Bitcoin in a traditional brokerage account without needing to manage private keys or cryptocurrency wallets.

Except I believe the major reason it diverges is they pay a dividend.


I've experience this with BTCFX (a mutual fund that used BITO). While the PRICE doesn't correlate, my PORTFOLIO has a pretty close correlation. That's because every month they pay me a dividend that equals close to the profits. As such, those dividends have a $0 cost basis, but it increases my shares. Thus, it's essentially equivalent.

;"Dude I never said the price matched it....reread my comment.


It pays a monthly dividend, which returns the value to it's holders. I hold a mutual fund (that basically only invests in BITO) and it pays a monthly dividend INSTEAD of fixing the premiums/discounts fluctuations that happen during the month so as to not mess up those contracts. They do this because traders use those swings. But holders want the assest value to reflect the price movement of the underlying asset. So instead they reciveve a dividend that's roughly proportional to the underlying asset profit. The price per share of BITO varies, but with the dividend, the asset grows proportional to Bitcoin.


The dividends explain the variation from NAV price.

A different way to lose your BTC that happened to me. ;"I'll make this short.


I held some BTC on an exchange because sometimes the fee market gets crazy and I wanted to have some I could sell if needed ready.

Also sometimes the exchanges stop working when they are busy . And sometimes I've lost access to my accounts until slow ass customer service can reinstate it after I send them ten pictures of my passport holding up papers with numbers.

So I put in a sell order a couple years ago in case I went into a coma or something or got locked out of my account. The well order was for 89999 which was a crazy amount years ago..

Well I completely forgot about that sell order and it triggered. When I finally decided to log in after years of not looking I didn't have BTC i just had USD trash. And the price ran higher I ended up panic buying in at higher price losing over .02 BTC and getting myself a nasty tax bill this year because it didn't mesh well with my tax planning . I will have to pay about 20k in extra taxes because of this if you include paying back aca subsidies 

Anyways I always enjoy learning valuable lessons from dumb fucks so I can avoid their mistakes. Let that be a lesson to you .

Don't be a fuck up dumb fuck like me 😭

Missed my opportunity in 2013, won’t miss it again;"Long story short I found out about Bitcoin in 2013 when it was about $100-200. I was 13 years of age at the time and told my dad to atleast throw $1000 into it at the time. He didn’t listen and now here we are…

I had no money at the time and was not able to get a job so that was a no go for me. 

Now I am 24, work full time and thank god still live at home with little to no bills. Over the next 2-3 years I will dump a majority of my saving/ extra money into BTC. Easily $300-500 a week if not more, since I still need to save money for bills/emergency fund when I decide to move out.

I WILL NOT miss this opportunity this time around. If you’re not a believer in BTC yet, you need to lock tf in and start buying ASAP. No matter the price.

Multisig with multiple SeedQRs and one Blockstream Jade?;"Hi all

Just wondering if it's possible to setup 2 of 3 multisig using only one Jade.

Basically this is my thought process: I'll generate 3 seed phrases and export them as SeedQRs. Then, I'll have just one Jade that I use only as a stateless signer.

Is it possible to use just the one Jade to scan 2 of the 3 SeedQRs in order to sign a multisig transaction? If so, how do I go about setting this up?

I use Sparrow wallet, so if anyone knows how to do it in Sparrow specifically, that'd be great, however I am open to receiving instructions for Green or something else as well.

Engineer Question - BTC Power Consumption;"So obviously Satoshi was a real thinker. Researching BTC consistently reveals nuanced layers to the protocol. 

However, as an engineer one line of thought that I have not found much documentation on, is if Satoshi projected growth and adoption in order to estimate total future energy consumption?

Recently, Saylor has been speaking about the energy consumption as a feature, since it represents the power required to hack the protocol. I think this is true, that the energy requirements can be viewed as a feature, but am curious if this was planned or is just an unintended consequence? 

Features of the energy consumption include the representation of the power and energy required to hack the network. Also, mining energy consumption does validate the price indirectly because it represents the real costs that participants are willing to bare to participate. 

It would have been possible for Satoshi or Hal Finney to make early models to estimate power consumption as a function of increasing hash rate, then postulate price based off that foundation. 

However, my understanding is that they did not model that. It makes me wonder if the larger power consumption of the network was truly pre-estimated and planned, or an unintended consequence.

;"I believe both of them foresaw a future where we would climb the Kardashev civilization scale.

A lot of people seem to equate high energy consumption with badness, mostly because we are currently dependent on fossil fuels for this.

Energy consumption itself is not bad. As a matter of fact, life quality of humans has so far scaled really well with increased energy consumption.

Bitcoins high energy use is quickly revealing how inadequate fossil fuels are for generating energy.";alive1;;4;0.0;2024-11-19;16:06:14;Comment;" I believe both of them foresaw a future where we would climb the Kardashev civilization scale.

;Good question, essentially about entropy. I'm going to guess that it's a happy accident. When you're architecting a new system like that, sometimes pieces just fall into place and it's best to not rock the boat.

Fuck it, I’ll do it myself.;"Over the years, we’ve all waited for a meaningful project that takes Bitcoin seriously—something real, accessible, and aligned with its core values. Instead, we’ve seen too many scams, hollow promises, and “brands” that miss the point entirely.

I’ve decided to dedicate the next month to building a project that reflects what this community truly stands for.

Here’s the plan:

	•	I’ll share the entire creation process publicly, step by step.

	•	The project will include a real-world way to trade and use Bitcoin, anywhere in the world.

	•	Everyone involved will have a chance to win Bitcoin as part of the launch.

This isn’t about hype or empty marketing. It’s about building something meaningful for Bitcoiners, with the community in mind.

First update coming in three days.

Let’s see if we can create something worth talking about.

;"Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners and look for the answers."

;"I too wanted to understand this.  It is confusing how a company with $30B in BTC can have a market cap of $80B.

Some mention the software business, which I have trouble understanding as I am not sure if the financials include the BTC purchases.  It looks like $500M in losses so far in 2024, which are actually gains if that includes $50k/btc purchases earlier this year.  From what I understand in the past (before the recent mania) was that its simply a leveraged BTC fund?  And also provides BTC exposure to more traditional folks (boomer on-ramp). 

Again, with $30B in BTC and $80B market cap, it has to be leveraged somehow.  My skepticism is to just own the underlying, self custody and all that.

My own synopsis:  I'd imagine if they dip below their average of $50k/btc, they will have issues or losses.  And you can only go so long operating at a loss before money runs out.  But I feel like when MicroStrategy issues more shares , diluting shareholders has a similar effect.  The multiple of BTC to MSFT market cap can't grow forever.

It feels like a dangerous game, dilution on one end with operating losses ""margin call"" risk on the other end.

Again, just owning the underlying assets, Bitcoin, seems like a better play.  But I also understand the value in a leveraged option for holding BTC.

Digital nomad: best ways to store my seed phrase?;"I've been traveling as a nomad for years and while I'm looking for a home, I don't how soon I'll find one. And I don't even know what country it'll be in.

For now, what are my least-bad options for storing my seed phrase/BTC?

Currently, I've got a Ledger hardware wallet and a metal plate with the seed phrase stamped in it.

These are stored in a family member's safe. But I don't want to rely on anyone. 

Then I've got a passphrase that I've memorized.

So this family member couldn't move my BTC, however they could deprive me of it, I suppose. I do trust them 100% but I'd rather onlt rely on myself 

So that's my current setup.

;Multi-sig is likely the answer for you. You can have a 2 of 4 set up. Any 2 keys from the 4 would be required to sign your transactions. One with you, one in your trusted safe, one in a safety deposit box in country A and the other in safety deposit box in country B. Make it hard to access your primary HODL wallet. This makes it so that none of your trusted key holders can sign your transactions on their own. And as you travel, the key you have with you is also not enough to sign anything. Remember, you don’t need to sign to receive Bitcoin. Only to spend it. This will not impact your DCA plan. This also greatly complicates a $5 wrench attack.  If you want to spend some, just use a lightning wallet on your phone with a small chunk of pocket change Bitcoin.

let's ignore that your assumption of '20 word' seed phrases is incorrect -- the current flavors are 12- or 24- words

we'll just focus on 12-word seed phrases for now

that's 5.4445179e+39, or five duodecillion four hundred forty-four undecillion five hundred seventeen decillion nine hundred nonillion different 12-word combinations

there's no built in limit to how many 'tries' a system can make at guessing them, other than the limitations of that system's processing power

let's be generous and assume your system can make 1 billion guesses per second, then it would only take you 1.7252636e+23 years to guess your 12-word mnemonic 

so sure, you can bruteforce it -- if you have one hundred seventy-two sextillion five hundred twenty-six quintillion three hundred sixty quadrillion years to spare

with any luck, maybe you can pull it off in under 6 billion years, before the sun dies and destroys the earth

it's also important to note that there aren't any devices that 'store' bitcoin, there are only nodes and miners that maintain a distributed ledger

;"Hi. 

Responding to your first point, as USA is the world reserve currency it makes little difference whether the debt is 20 trillion or 30 trillion. In fact even if it were 200 trillion, yes that could be a difficult thing to manage, but all the same USA controls the world and the money markets. Other countries must hold US dollars to trade (play the game). You cant lose when you are the bank. Yes at some point eventually the currency will inflate to a low point and then they will create a new one, this is not a new thing. This is by design, debt is not inherently a bad thing, its acutally a very useful tool to enable us to bring forward future value.

Bitcoin was introduced as peer to peer digital cash, however that has not panned out well at all, so at this time it appears to be a speculative instrument/hedge against inflationary fiat.

So you are correct to say it can protect you from getting screwed, certainly if your native currency is in poor shape USD will hold its value better, hence all countries holding it or trying to, and Bitcoin possibly better again depending the time period.";LiquifiedRocketFuel;;1;0.0;2024-11-19;06:11:39;Comment;" Hi.

But then again, the halving is every 4 years and with only a 3t total market cap as of right now, it’s impossible to tell were this could be in 10 years. Bitcoin is a currency, but also store of value so it depends on how it’s being utilized also.

Yes, there are two basic ways: you (your wallet) combine those two addresses in an outgoing transaction, making it obvious that both must have the same owner.

Stronghold Finally Agreed to Pay $4.75M And 25 Bitcoins to Investors Over 2021 IPO Scandal;"Hey there, I guess there are some Stronghold investors here, good news for y’all — Stronghold’s finally agreed to settle the financial issues they had a few years ago.



For newbies, back in 2022, Stronghold was accused of hiding issues with contracted suppliers, missed deadlines, and difficulties in obtaining new mining equipment. In March 2022, their financial reports revealed losses higher than they had claimed during their IPO a few months earlier. 



As a result, $SDIG fell, and investors filed a lawsuit alleging they were misled about Stronghold’s mining capacity, operational costs, and the feasibility of expanding its mining fleet during its IPO.



The good news is that the company finally agreed to pay investors $4.75M + 25 BTC over this whole situation. So, if you were an investor back then, you can check the details and [file for payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/strongholddigital-investor-settlement).



Anyways, did you invest in Stronghold back then? How big were your losses due to all this?

Trading on top of DCAing;Currently I DCA 30 euro a day in binance and then move it to my own wallet when the balance gets to high. I feel like trying to trade on top of it is a no brainer. If I set up a Binance trading bot to keep buying when it drops and selling when it goes up it should keep making profit right? The only risks are the Bitcoin drops past my last purchase price but then I'm just stuck with Bitcoin that I'm happy to hold anyway.

;This is poor logic. Most people do not own gold as a store of value because it's incredibly inconvenient to hold spot gold, and it doesn't really appreciate. If it were easier to hold and deploy, many more people would hold it instead of cash in their safes or stocks in their brokerage accounts (assuming the person understands the cost of inflation). Similarly, many people store their wealth in land/real estate, despite it being extremely inconvenient as well, because real estate at least does a pretty good job of fighting inflation.

Is Bitcoin Still the People’s Currency, or Just a Tool for the Wealthy ?;"Why is Bitcoin often described as a tool for financial freedom and “the people’s currency” that we should buy to gain autonomy over our finances, when it seems like financial institutions, corporations, and other large entities are the ones accumulating most of it? I can imagine a future where the vast majority—maybe over 90%—of Bitcoin is owned by these big players, leaving less than 10% in the hands of ordinary people.

In such a scenario, Bitcoin would become extremely difficult for the average person to acquire because no one would want to sell, and its accessibility could disappear entirely. What happens then?

I can imagine a future where the vast majority—maybe over 90%—of Bitcoin is owned by these big players, leaving less than 10% in the hands of ordinary people.

;"\> Why is Bitcoin often described as a tool for financial freedom and “the people’s currency”

Because it sounds cool? Its a vague catchphrase that can mean anything, like America being the land of the free. 

\> when it seems like financial institutions, corporations, and other large entities are the ones accumulating most of it

Because they are co-operative entities comprising of numerous individuals with wealth. Thus, they control a lot of wealth compare to some one guy. 

\>I can imagine a future where the vast majority—maybe over 90%—of Bitcoin is owned by these big players, leaving less than 10% in the hands of ordinary people.

In all advanced economies, the wealthy control a disproportionate percentage of wealth. So you should expect the distribution of Bitcoin to follow a similar path. There is nothing in the Bitcoin protocol that says that everyone should have an equal amount of bitcoins. If your think that everyone having an equal amount of wealth is a good thing, I'd suggest you read more about communism. If you are stupid, you might find that communism is more your thing, not Bitcoin. If you are smart, you'll find that communism is stupid and human societies function horribly when the government forces an equal distribution of wealth amongst its populace.

\> Bitcoin would become extremely difficult for the average person to acquire because no one would want to sell, and its accessibility could disappear entirely.

No because bitcoin can be subdivided into smaller units. Yes, it will be harder and harder to own a single bitcoin as the price appreciates.

;"There are people and entities who sell options. When an entity sells a call option, it is wise for them to buy some amount of the underlying as a hedge. That way they make money if the price goes down (from selling calls) and they make money if the price goes up (from owning the underlying). These positions somewhat cancel each other out so they weight their positions probabilistically. The same is true in reverse for selling puts and selling the underlying asset. This is what the hedge in hedge fund refers to. 

A gamma squeeze is when there is heavy demand for buying options, which ""forces"" sellers of options to buy/sell large amounts of the underlying to hedge those positions. It can cause large price movements the same way a short squeeze can, for example.

"Bitcoin ""stock split""? ";"I was wondering if there was talk of ever implementing a ""stock split"" for bitcoin, now that price is about to breach 100k. If there was a 10-1 split for instance at 100k, there would be 210M possible bitcoin, all holders would receive 10x their bitcoin, miners would receive 31.25 BTC per block, every bitcoin would be equal 10M satoshi. 

This would solely be done to bring the price of bitcoin ""back to earth"" psychologically. The value of one bitcoin would be more in the scale of reasonable everyday transactions. People not yet invested would have hope of owning a bitcoin. 

Would this be trivial to implement? Could it achieve consensus? Is it a good idea at all?

IBIT can be borrowed against with a PAL from Schwab;"I don't know if this helps anyone, and I just noticed it today, but up until recently Bitcoin ETFs were listed as a 0% contributor toward a Pledged Asset Line with Schwab.  This meant that you couldn't borrow against it like you could your more traditional stock/etf portfolio.  I'm not sure how much this varies but my line item shows a 50% value contribution now.  For reference, 70% is used for stocks that I hold and ETFS like SPY VOO etc.

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

**For those of you wanting to keep your bitcoin**, but you want to be able to use the gains that you have to buy a house or whatever, you can now simply apply for a Pledged Asset Line or (PAL) if you have your coins within IBIT.  I'm using mine to help with a new house purchase.  I had already set up the PAL a few months before but it was going to be a tight squeeze for borrowing, but now I've got a much higher ceiling on my PAL and there are no concerns.

A Thanksgiving Bitcoin Conversation Guide;"Forget talking about religion and politics at the Thanksgiving table, now is the time to share the Gospel of Bitcoin:

Opening the Conversation

""Hey, with all the financial news lately, I've been learning about Bitcoin. Would you be interested in hearing a simple explanation of what it is?""

Basic Explanation

""Bitcoin is like digital gold - it's a new form of money that exists on computers instead of as physical cash or gold. Just like how email replaced letters for sending messages, Bitcoin is trying to modernize how we store and transfer value.

The key things that make Bitcoin special are:
- There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin
- No government or company controls it
- You can send it to anyone in the world almost instantly
- It's secured by advanced math and computers instead of banks""

 Addressing Common Questions

""Isn't it just made up money?""
""All money is essentially made up - the dollar used to be backed by gold but hasn't been since 1971. Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, computing power, and the trust of millions of users worldwide.""

""I heard it's used by criminals?""
""Actually, cash is still criminals' preferred choice since Bitcoin transactions are all recorded publicly. Major companies like PayPal and Fidelity now offer Bitcoin services.""

""What makes it valuable?""
""Bitcoin is valuable for similar reasons as gold: it's scarce (limited supply), durable (can't be destroyed), portable (send it anywhere), and can't be counterfeited. Plus, it has advantages gold doesn't - you can send it instantly and store millions worth in a small device.""

Investment Discussion

""As for investing, here are the key points to consider:
1. Bitcoin is still a young technology and can be volatile
2. It's best to start small and learn as you go
3. Think of it as digital gold for the internet age
4. Only invest what you can afford to lose
5. Consider it a long-term investment (5+ years)

The important thing isn't to invest today - it's to understand what Bitcoin is and why it might be important for the future of money.""

Closing Thoughts

""Whether you decide to buy any or not, I think it's worth understanding Bitcoin because it could become an important part of our financial future. What are your thoughts about it?""

Full YouTube Channel Appeal;"I would like to formally appeal this decision by YouTube to permanently remove my channel. https://www.YouTube.com/@BITC0IN

After carefully reviewing the harmful and dangerous rules, I did not find any violations. My channel does not contain any videos that violate the law or encourage it. There is no propaganda for illegal or dangerous activities, there is no encouragement of hacking.

In my videos, I provide the viewer with the latest news related only to Bitcoin (which is legal in developed countries). These are neutral educational, documentary, scientific and artistic video content, in the public domain. Some videos may have been reused content, but none were harmful or dangerous. All my links in the description of each video were relevant and harmless.

I am not an expert in law and if I did violate anything, please point to a specific example or is there something I can do, change the channel, delete the video, change the content, anything to restore the channel, I am very willing to do it or have it done for me.
What videos were harmful and dangerous and why (I truly believe they were all harmless)? I hope that the removal of these videos will be satisfactory. Also in my defense, my channel had no strikes before this. Deleting a channel with zero strikes is pretty extreme.

I have worked very hard to keep this channel clean from any harmful influence (I have declined all promotion offers because of this), I have tried to provide quality information about Bitcoin in good faith for almost a decade on YouTube with this channel and I would like to continue to do so. I think it has helped people understand Bitcoin in a much safer way than most crypto channels on YouTube today. Linking to quality Bitcoin resources like reddit.com/r/bitcoin, where I have helped moderate for a few years is one such example of a good Bitcoin resource I think. There’s also the Bitcoin discord tech chat, where we help people to use Bitcoin responsibly and troubleshoot their technical issues. For this and more examples see http://bitcoinproductions.com 

My channel is dedicated to publishing publicly available sources of information that are relevant to current events and the history of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto. I really just want to help people learn about this new and growing phenomenon by showcasing neutral educational, documentary, scientific and artistic video content in the public domain. One example of this is the Bitcoin Optech podcast which covers technical developments in the Bitcoin software ecosystem on a weekly basis.

I am sure the channel was deleted in error and once you understand my purely good faith intentions you will be able to restore it.

I would really like for this to end here, I hope it will. Thank you for your consideration in reinstating this channel. I apologize if I did anything harmful or dangerous, I don't think I did that, really. And if I did, I am willing to take corrective action to fix it until the channel is restored. I would like to be informed of what was harmful and dangerous so that I do not do it again.

A veey newbie question but,what reasons makes bitcoin not something that will take a hit in its growth or adoption by seeing all the wall street investments and other financial things happening ;"I get that by walk street coming in,we get 

More btc exposure to the retail markets who will buy those etf from their Robinhood accounts 

More liquidity (although they will hodl) and I also think btc also needs it to continue 

More market cap (which btc needs )


But things like yen-usd carry trade or the value of usd being factuated here and there 


All in all I am trying to know is what is really necessary other then adoption and use cases,(which we terribly need because we simply don't have any infra on people adopting it in retail but I guess it will in some years

But why 

Why bitcoin will be something that won't be affected with all the strong things that may hinder its growth 
?

Why would it be worth 500k? 5 million a coin ?

What supports that value ?
It's use case ? 
The trading and investment value ? That we all bitcoiners have built ?
Or is there something else which i am not able to understand 


I also understand that it's better then gold knowing 80 % of golds ivalue is based digital trading value and 20 % use case in electronics and etc 

I also understand that its easy to carry ,nobody will stop me from carrying my sats and btc on the plane while gold will not let me go 

I also understand that it's much better then real estate (or in a way) 
That it's liquid,

You own a farmland which you can sell anytime,anywhere,
I get that this is its value and tagline that makes btc very big asset knowing all btc needs is market cap 

I also think that btc's current market cap is less for its price that it has reached but this can be debated 

But any other reasons why it can't be hindered ?

I reject your premise. Bitcoin HAS taken many ""hits"". As an investment, it hasn't consistently increased in value over short time periods.

I'm using it, because i'm looking on it as an provider for compounding interest on my crypto assets, mainly.

;"This is correct. The only thing I’d say is that inflation is more nuanced than just “print money bad.” 

If money is printed and spent on productive things that cause GDP to increase then we don’t get inflation. These sorts of expenditures increase supply and even if demand goes up we net out. Inflation of the last 5 years was definitely driven in part by printing, but also because of supply chains breaking down and sticky prices. 

I’m glad you commented tho. Your main point is correct and it’s really cool. 

The deficit is just the amount of money the government left in the system. If they spend $100 and tax $90 then they leave $10 in our pockets. If they took it all back there’d be no money to spend. A government deficit is like a private surplus. This is good. That’s what drives the business cycle. 

The “debt” is just the amount of money the government would have to pay if all the nations with accounts at the Fed came and withdrew their money all at once. Just like a regular bank. It’s not money we borrowed from China. 

Bitcoiners think they figured out some secret conspiracy, but in reality, the system is all very transparent and the basics are easy to learn. 

Fiat money turns money and the ability to accrue wealth from a zero-sum game into a win-win game with some losing every now and then. When you’re the world reserve currency the risk of the system getting out of control is really quite small. 

If gold or bitcoin is the base, then the game is to acquire more bitcoin, and if history is any indicator, the acquisition of hard assets and commodities is usually done at the tip of a spear.

;"Fiat survives on debt, therefore there's an arbitrage opportunity called the cantillon effect.  Debt acts as a gatekeeper in the fiat system, by locking up economic value in a form that can only be unlocked by completing the payment obligations. This ensures that the financial system has a steady stream of obligations that help sustain the flow of currency, which gives fiat currency its value.


Raising interest rates actually works by cutting off this debt, as well as new money supply the debt creates, so people in aggregate can't buy as many goods if debt is more expensive to survice.  More debt needs to be created to pay off the old debt, as the new debt creates the extra money supply to pay the interest on the old debt, so people begin to default on their past debt as rates rise, and we usually get a 2008 style recession.

;"As a fellow GenX, thank you for trying. I’ve given up. I’m not one to try and tell people how to invest, but the cyclic halving pattern is hard to ignore.

Honestly this is a very interesting question. I consider myself more savvy than most when it comes to traditional investing. Until recently I was just going to manage everything myself.  I mean what's so hard, you toss half of it into an index fund and then half of it into bonds or something. Or alternatively you sign up with a robo-broker and just let the algorithms run it. 

  
For me it came down to a question of expertise. There's value in having an expert run things for you. I've been in the IT industry for 30 years and I ALWAYS bitched about people who would try to cobble together their own solutions for something and ended up with an inferior result. If they'd just consult an expert they'd get a better result for less time/money.

Beginner question: could you use a SD card as a HWW?;As the title says: could you, for example, create a BTC wallet in Sparrow and transfer the wallet file to a SD card, as it was a HWW?;1pctipaday;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gu0wxi/beginner_question_could_you_use_a_sd_card_as_a_hww/;0;16.0;2024-11-18;09:21:54;Post;Beginner question: could you use a SD card as a HWW? As the title says: could you, for example, create a BTC wallet in Sparrow and transfer the wallet file to a SD card, as it was a HWW?
;"No. The point of the hardware wallet is that it doesn't allow you to copy the key off the hardware wallet. Instead it performs the transaction signing itself and returns the signed transaction to the computer. 

The difference is basically the API that the device exposes to the computer it's plugged into. An SD card has a filesystem API that does things like roadblock and writeblock. A hardware wallets API on the other hand allows writekey or maybe createkey to have it generate one itself and signtransaction to sign a transaction. But notice no readkey API. You can't read the key off the device back to the computer.

A common device that could perhaps do this is a simcard. It works the same way and for the same reason - to stop you cloning the phone ki and using the same account on multiple phones.

I'm not really sure why simcards aren't commonly used perhaps there's no implementation of the bitcoin tx signing algorithm available and noone trusts themselves to try and make one? I suppose for the end user most may not have a smart ard reader so it makes sense to make something with a usb interface. Another key point is that the hardware wallet usually needs a screen and buttons in order to allow you to securely verify that it's signing the right thing. If it just blindly signs whatever the computer gives it, then the computer might switch transactions on you.. in the wallet software you might construct a transaction that pays to the pizza delivery yous address but when you plug in the hardware wallet it swaps the tx to one paying a hacker before sending it to the hardware wallet. If there's no UI on the wallet there's no way to check you're signing the right tx.";longjumpsignal;;7;0.0;2024-11-18;09:54:36;Comment;" No. The point of the hardware wallet is that it doesn't allow you to copy the key off the hardware wallet.

My impressions as someone who‘s new to Bitcoin;"Hi,

I‘m new to investing money in general. I‘ve invested about 3.6k $of my (extremely limited) savings since March and, since I put about half of that into Bitcoin, I‘ve turned a great profit (if I cashed out all my investments now I‘d get 4.7k $ back). I‘ve been reading posts in this sub when they pop up on my timeline, and I‘ve been wanting to share some impressions and questions with the community.

  
I‘m not looking to offend anyone and the things I‘m about to ask aren‘t too controversial I hope.

  
1. Some of the people HODLING seem to be gambling on the collapse of fiat currencies. Like most people, I‘ve noticed the steady decay of purchasing power with my currency (€). I‘m grateful for the opportunity to funnel some of my disposable income into Bitcoin in order to preserve what little I‘ve been able to save over the past years.

However, I‘m not looking forward to the collateral of a collapse of big fiat currencies. I think it‘d mean a period of chaos and many, many people would really suffer, who knows for how long. I realise the system we live in is very much flawed. It‘s unjust, it caters to those who already have more than they could possibly spend or even enjoy, it does not supply the weakest of its members with basic amenities. It wreaks havoc on the planet and, in most aspects, it‘s becoming worse, not better. My problem is that I cannot see how a collapse of fiat and subsequent chaos would make things better. 

  
2. The US American election: I realise and acknowledge that I do not have a say in US American politics. I do have a right to my own opinion, though. I wouldn‘t call myself an expert on politics, but I work as a teacher for English and Poltical Education in a European country, so I‘m obligated to keep up with current events and read up on stuff. I‘m really worried about the impact Trump‘s policies are going to have on the American people. Him making promises towards the “Bitcoin-community“ (for lack of a better word) is not a worthwhile trade-off and I hate the fact that by owning Bitcoin I suddenly was to benefit from Trump‘s election.

I‘m ordering „The Bitcoin Standard“ today to read up more on Bitcoin and I‘m opening up a proper wallet (instead of buying through a trading app like I‘ve been doing until now), even though I don‘t fully understand why that‘s better yet :D.

  
I realise my thoughts don‘t really come with questions, but still I‘m excited to hear your opinions on my impressions.

;"History tends to rhyme.

Once, the pound was the world reserve currency. During WWII, the UK racked up a debt-to-gdp ratio over 250%. In 1931, **the pound went off the gold standard**. Over the course of 30 or 40 years, the UK managed to get the debt-to-gdp ratio back under control, below a respectable 50%.

How?

Once, the pound was the world reserve currency. During WWII, the UK racked up a debt-to-gdp ratio over 250%. In 1931, **the pound went off the gold standard**. Over the course of 30 or 40 years, the UK managed to get the debt-to-gdp ratio back under control, below a respectable 50%.

;">I haven't read either, and I know recommending books I haven't read is dumb, but I'd recommend Lyn Alden's book ""Broken Money"" over Saifedean's.

I've read both as have many here, and I think most of us would agree. 

Bitcoin Standard is great but goes off the rails at points - the whole middle portion of the book, really. It starts really strong with its history of money, then he gets kooky with personal biases for a good while taking about US monetary policy in particular, then pulls it back together talking about bitcoin for the last chapters. Super fun easy read that my young daughter could probably grasp. 

Broken Money is still an easy read for lay folk like myself, but a lot more meat on the bone in terms of content. Kinda like reading Chomsky now that I think about it, in that the book is able to communicate complex ideas is an easily digestible format; no reading the same page 5 times trying to grasp some deep concept (talking to you in your grave, Marshall McLuhan). 

Now that I'm fleshing out thoughts, I think I would ideally recommend both, but bitcoin standard first, especially for someone new to bitcoin. Someone who has never heard of btc could pick up a copy bitcoin standard with zero primer and I feel could be fully enthralled, even developing interest to learn further. 

Not sure I could say the same for broken money, but I'd wager 9/10 people who have been into bitcoin awhile and are not named Saifedean, would she that broken money is a better & more complete book that gives you a better and broader understanding of money overall. 

Finally if you really want to get heavy, if there's any room left on your plate, I'd suggest something like Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell. Nothing to do with Bitcoin at all, and everything to do with how a market economy functions. Read through it keeping an eye towards how it might apply to bitcoin, and it becomes even clearer how over time it will only make sense for most everyone to use bitcoin, as it is better, and regarding a market economy when a tool is better it is generally as inevitable as gravity.";omellil;;2;0.0;2024-11-18;16:55:27;Comment;" >I haven't read either, and I know recommending books I haven't read is dumb, but I'd recommend Lyn Alden's book ""Broken Money"" over Saifedean's.

Help!!;Okay, so I have read hundred of posts like this but unlike others I am absolutely certain about having recieved Bitcoin back in 2010. Okay so I had made a digital purchase for a PC game online and the laptop I had would not run it, I was trying to get a refund for the game and the site was either going to make me wait 5-7 business days to go back on my account or it offered me digital currency, I had heard of it before but I didn't know I couldn't use it at all to make a new purchase back then.. I was quite upset even worse it was about $75 worth of Bitcoin in 2010, so yeah... Alot of $$$ now.. how would I find this Bitcoin? I believe it was linked to my old yahoo account but it has been deactivated, where would it go? I had also done this with another purchase later on that year with an actual Bitcoin service (or at least a more popular one) for about $55 I remember trying to add them together but not being able to figure it out so I gave up and kinda just let it go since it wasn't gaining any value it looking promising, well y'all know how bitcoin rocketed in 2021? I read an article on FB and frantically started trying to get into my Yahoo Mail account from back then and about 30 mins into it I had remembered that a friend of mine showed me how to put the $55 of Bitcoin I had onto a USB drive.. and the search began I remembered it was a silver switchblade style thumb drive and I put a $ symbol on it with a sharpie it was nowhere to be found :( then I remembered.. I was at my dad's it had to be in my stuff there I had a box with my stuff in my old closet and a little wooden box with thumb drives of old pictures and my WOW account key so I raced to his house and sure enough there it was after about a day or so of carefully researching how to use it I found a specialist to help me and next thing I knew I had almost 550 bitcoin, I literally melted.. well now I know I have even more and I want to gain access to it as Bitcoin is worth almost 100k I need advice idk if it's linked to my Yahoo or what service Yahoo used back then, but there weren't very many digital currency sites or apps back in 2010 I just don't know which ones there were or where I should check, I'm certain it's somewhere I just need to find it so anyone with advice please help!

Just an update, I was able to retrieve my bitcoin already and not asking for the 2fa. I downloaded the blue wallet and it did accept my 24 word combination. Thank you so much to all the people who shared insights here, those who warned me, and people that give extra effort trying to do a sample and sharing it to me without asking for anything in return.

;"Just my 2 cents worth :

You have the 24 word seed phrase (guard them with your life!), that uniquely identifies the address which hold the BTC, and you can access that with any wallet software. The wallet software you are using has the 2FA set, if you enter the seed phrase in any other wallet software (I use electrum) you should not have any 2FA, unless you choose that when setting up the new wallet software (but then you also set a new 2FA method which works).

Someone corrects me if I'm wrong, but in testing out electrum I restored a 2FA protected electrum wallet on a different machine, and it worked perfectly, no 2FA required.

You seem to want to sell the coins, that will be the next hurdle, perhaps you will have to transfer them to an exchange to sell against fiat. But first recover the wallet. A lot of helpful info on the electrum site.";Ikkedacht;;21;0.0;2024-11-18;10:01:59;Comment;" Just my 2 cents worth :

;"If this is real. You basically have two separate decisions:
1) How much, in terms of percent, do you lump sum buy versus allocate to DCA
2) what period of time do you DCA over

1 is more important. A couple things to note, on average, lump sum, as soon as possible is the best strategy. But it comes with the risk of emotional hurt if there is a large drop in price.

So for #1 do some thought experiments. Imagine allocating 50% to lump sum and 50% to dca. How would you feel given the following circumstances:
1) bitcoin trades sideways
2) bitcoin drops for a period of time (before going back up)
3) bitcoin drops for a long time (unlikely IMO)
4) bitcoin shoots up rapidly and never comes down

Mark down which scenario you would feel the most regret and rate it on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being no regret, to 5 being the worst of thoughts). Then do the same activity allocating 100% to bitcoin and then with 100% to DCA. Pick the strategy with the worst possible regret being the lowest. You can toy around with the percentages too.

Then move on to decision #2. You could do the same exercise as above but I think this decision matters a lot less. You probably want to think about it in terms of when the next super-cycle will peak: january, April, July, 2026, after that would be rather atypical.

Noob advice: Use a hot wallet before using cold storage. ;"Like the title says, if you're new to bitcoin, you should first become familiar with a hot wallet before opting into cold storage. 

A hot wallet is simply a bitcoin wallet that allows you to take personal custody of your coins, and move them off of an exchange. 

These ""hot wallets"" are often free apps, like Green wallet or Blue wallet that allow you to create a seed phrase to recover your coins. They allow you to interface with the bitcoin network by sending or receiving coins that you personally control in a self custody wallet.
(BEWARE OF SCAM WALLET PROVIDERS!)

Far too often the advice being given to new users is to go out and buy an expensive ledger or other cold storage solution, when it would be advisable to first take possession of your BTC in a hot wallet so that you can become familiar with how to use the bitcoin network.

This is especially true for small amounts that a new investor may be allocating to bitcoin for the first time. Once you have accumulated a meaningful amount of bitcoin, lets put that figure at 0.01 BTC + perhaps then you can look into a cold storage device or opendime.

TL;DR if you're new to bitcoin, consider moving your funds off an exchange into a wallet that you control. You should become familair with how a hot wallet works before opting for cold storage. It's smart to secure your key (seed phrase) to secure your coins.

How do you explain Bitcoin to someone who doesn’t trust digital anything?;"How do you explain Bitcoin to someone who doesn’t trust digital anything? I’m asking because so much of Bitcoin’s value is tied to its digital nature - its decentralized ledger, cryptographic security, and accessibility all exist in the digital world.

;"Explaining Bitcoin to someone who doesn’t trust digital systems requires framing it in terms they value, like transparency, security, and decentralization, while addressing their concerns about the digital aspect

	1.	Start with What They Value:
Explain that Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any single entity, government, or corporation. It’s a system run by a global network of individuals who verify and secure transactions together. This decentralized structure is designed to make it harder to corrupt than centralized digital systems.
	2.	Focus on Its Transparency:
Bitcoin’s ledger, the blockchain, is fully transparent. Every transaction ever made is publicly recorded and cannot be altered without the consensus of the majority. Compare this to traditional financial systems, where ledgers are private and controlled by a few institutions.
	3.	Highlight the Security Aspect:
Bitcoin uses cryptographic principles to secure transactions, making it one of the most secure systems in existence. Explain how this cryptography doesn’t rely on trust in a person or institution but on mathematics, which doesn’t take sides or make mistakes.
	4.	Explain the Physical Connection:
Even though Bitcoin is digital, you can make it tangible. Wallets can be stored offline on hardware devices or even as printed QR codes on paper, much like cash. This gives the owner full control and keeps it separate from the internet.
	5.	Discuss Trust in Systems vs. Trust in People:
If they distrust digital systems because of people misusing them, emphasize that Bitcoin’s design minimizes human intervention. It operates automatically based on predefined rules in its code.
	6.	Draw Historical Analogies:
Compare Bitcoin to older forms of money. People once doubted paper money when it replaced coins made of precious metals. Bitcoin is another evolution of value storage, just as paper money was.
	7.	Acknowledge Their Concerns:
Don’t dismiss their skepticism. Instead, agree that no system, digital or not, is perfect. However, explain that Bitcoin tries to solve many flaws in traditional systems by reducing reliance on trust.";Dependent-Routine-80;;12;0.0;2024-11-18;03:02:54;Comment;" Explaining Bitcoin to someone who doesn’t trust digital systems requires framing it in terms they value, like transparency, security, and decentralization, while addressing their concerns about the digital aspect

;"A lot of those ‘millionaires’ have most of it tied up in a couple of assets.  A well heeled couple nearing retirement might own a house worth 750k and have 250k in retirement savings.

There is a world of difference between that kind of ‘common’ Millionaire, who would struggle to get the cash to buy .35 BTC at short notice, and someone with 990 million.

My point is the number of people who can immediately redeploy substantial cash amounts is smaller than you might think.

Best options for leveraging responsibly into BTC;"Looking for some advice on how best to increase my bitcoin holdings.  I started stacking 7 months ago when I cut my 401(k) savings back and have been DCA’ing the difference since then.  But I want to invest more now with leverage I can afford to pay back over time.

I have a substantial amount of home equity, but the existing line of credit is north of 8% interest.  Or I could refinance at like 6.5% interest and take the cash out.  Third option would be to borrow from the 401(k) and pay myself back.  But if something happens at work and I’m looking for a new job, then that loan is treated like a distribution with 10% penalty and taxes due.  

What other options am I not thinking about?  Or is this a dumb idea and I should just keep up the DCA?  Appreciate the feedback.

Other than that you hold because there's no point in sitting on cash. It's being debased consistently."

;"It's a sound idea. Since you asked how to do this properly, here are a few very important things to consider:

1. You need buy Bitcoin with the idea of not touching it for 4-5 years at a minimum. Ideally 10+. Why? Because in the past Bitcoin has dropped dramatically, before recovering even more dramatically. Next year we will most likely see a huge upswing, followed by a possible cliff dive in 2026. Past cycles are no guarantee of the future, but you have to be mentally prepared to see it drop by 80% and have the financial solvency and the nerve to not touch it. In fact, in those 80% drops you have to be buying as much as you can. If you can pull that off just for one cycle (4-5 years), depending on how much you stack, you might be set for life. It's a long journey. It will test your character, your will, your temperament, your patience, your foresight, etc. You have to understand that's what you are signing up for. Otherwise, you will most likely panic sell and lose $. 

2. After reaching a few thousand dollars worth of BTC in your account on Cashapp, you should research how to do self-custody, and take possession of your coins. This protects you both from hackers compromising your Cashapp account, and Cashapp going belly up for whatever reason. Good hardware wallets like Jade, coldcard, seedsigner, cost $200 at most, some less than $100. Then a good metal backup to protect from fire or flood, another $100. That's a very low cost for really good security. 

3. Do not talk about how much you are stacking with other people. Do it quietly if possible. If you talk to others, never divulge the size to your stack. That means your own parents, your wife, your kids, your anyone. 10 Bitcoin in early 2017 was $10k. Nobody would have batted an eye about it. But today, 10 BTC is life changing money. You might not think the $1000 a month you dump into BTC today is worth much. But in 10 years, you might not want your friend Gary knowing you have $1 million ""under your mattress."" Save yourself the headache. 

There are many other things to consider, but those are some of the main ones. Godspeed and HODL.";00_Jose_Maria_00;;1;0.0;2024-11-18;02:31:33;Comment;" It's a sound idea. Since you asked how to do this properly, here are a few very important things to consider:

Borrowing against BTC, or student loans?;"My wife plans to go back to grad school next year. My plan was to borrow against our BTC to finance the tuition with a loan. But today we talked about taking out a student loan instead to pay for it. 

The thinking is that a student loan doesn't require any payments until the student graduates, which would give us at least a few years of HODLing our BTC before we ever had to pay a dime. However, I hate the idea of going into any debt, and the risk is that we could be saddled with student debt and less value in our BTC if it depreciated.

If we fight about Bitcoin one more time I'm breaking up with him;"I have gone through almost every post explaining how Bitcoin works and I still do not understand. Sorry if this is repetitive and gets taken down but I am tired of getting in to fights with my boyfriend because he thinks he is explaining it well and hes not. So far this is my understanding from my own research:

The concept of bitcoin is to have a form of transaction that can be made directly from buyer to seller without cuts being taken out by middle parties.

Bitcoins are mined by individuals participating in a pool and verifying these transactions. As a result of solving it they are rewarded Bitcoin.

This Bitcoin is then shared amongst the pool and once the transactions are permanently verified they become a block which stacks on previous sealed transactions resulting in a blockchain.

The value of bitcoin is based essentially on people deciding to value it.

This is my understanding as of right now. Where I get lost is on that last step, the value of it. Yes everything has value because we just decide it does like gold, or paper money. But I don't understand how the value of this came to be accepted and how there is a finite number of it. Is the value of it from the verification process? How is Bitcoin generated and rewarded as a result of the verification process? Is my basic understanding of it even correct??

;"bitcoin is valuable because it solved digital scarcity.

bitcoin solved digital scarcity by making people that want it to actually use electricity, making them pay a real world physical cost to obtain it which is what mining is. machines that guess a bunch of numbers to find the special number that costs them electricity. if they are lucky they are rewarded bitcoin. they are only rewarded bitcoin because nodes around the world verify that the miner didn’t cheat.

bitcoin is scarce because the 21 million limit is protected by the nakamoto consensus meaning that the nodes around the world that run the bitcoin protocol that has the code saying the bitcoin limit is 21 million enforce the code by running that version of the bitcoin protocol. if a node runs a different version of the protocol that says bitcoin has a 50 billion limit it is cut off from the network.

If there are not many people that want to buy it, the price will be low, or close to zero. As demand increases and more people want to have your item, it's price will also increase.

;"The value is determined like everything else in a free market system: there is a continuous string of buyers and sellers determining the price via what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to sell for.

If there's more buyers than sellers, this puts the sellers at an advantage and they can continue to raise the price they're asking for it. When that equation shifts and you suddenly have more sellers than buyers, the price goes down because people are trying to unload for whatever price they can get while buyers get more and more timid in their bid offers to take them off the hands of sellers.

Miners are in control of the supply of new bitcoin. Every halving, they are paid half of what they used to for winning a hash (in terms of number of bitcoin awarded for 'winning' the hash). This decreases the rate of supply dilution, which makes things increasingly bullish as dilution is a form of increasing selling pressure vs buyers. Miners themselves can also act as bid support. If the price of bitcoin dips below the cost it takes for them to mine new bitcoin, they may start to buy them up to keep the price closer to where the cost of mining is and hope that buyers eventually come back and start a buying frenzy driving the price up again.

Eventually buyers \*do\* get into a bit of a frenzy when they see a large uptrend start and the cost to buy bitcoin goes well above the cost to mine it. As price gets really crazy, those who have held bitcoin for awhile (including miners) sense a good opportunity to sell what they have at a very profitable price, eventually this shifts the equation to the point where sellers once again outnumber buyers and the price starts a down cycle again.";duboilburner;;6;0.0;2024-11-17;20:45:22;Comment;" The value is determined like everything else in a free market system: there is a continuous string of buyers and sellers determining the price via what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to sell for.

Dollars and Euros are created out of thin air every time a bank gives out credit, and back in 2008 we've seen banks that were a bit lazy about checking the collaterals for those credits. Thus, the value of bitcoin is not only determined by the trust people have in an open-source algorithm, but even more by the distrust they have in banks, central banks, governments, and fiat currencies."

;"You have the details correct, to answer your question, when someone solves a block, they are able to make a special transaction that doesnt have any inputs and amount is a function of the length of the blockchain.  Naturally, who ever solves the block, sends these bitcoins to themselves, usually the pool, and distributes the rewards. That is how bitcoins are created.

The value is an intersubjective reality. Two or more people have to agree that something has value and then a market is born.

Bitcoin is bigger than money.

For any of us to cooperate, we need a ledger to register trades of goods, services and currencies.

In the beginning, when we were tribes of a maximum of 150, we just remembered. The tribe trusted each other. But that trust doesnt scale.

As we grew and settled with agriculture, we made clay protocuniform tablets, this allowed trust to scale to 1000s.

We then moved to printing press, stronger regulatory governments, we could scale that trust of a list to millions.

We then moved to central databases, that allowed our trust to scale up to nation states of people in the billions.

Every modern state is essentially a ledger of currency, ledger of property titles and a ledger of equities. There are other financial products as well, like bonds, options and futures. These are settled by clearing houses and they scale up to the size of the nation state, but not past it because these central ledgers have to be policed by governments to make sure no one cheats.

Bitcoin scales past that, it's trust scalability is unbounded.

;"Your question about what causes it to have value is really asking what the basis of money is. I know that sounds condescending, but have you ever thought about it? If you have a chicken that lays eggs and you have a few too many, you could trade me some eggs for some milk from my cow. That barter system works great, as long as there’s a coincidence of me wanting what you’re selling at the same time that you want to sell it (and vice versa), and the two things being basically similar in scale and time (if you were trying to sell your eggs to me for a house, I can’t break down the house and sell you a window here and a bathroom door there, and by the time you could save up enough eggs to buy the whole house, they’d have rotted and would be useless). Money comes into play here. We can’t use just anything as money, like if you picked up a leaf of the ground, you couldn’t trade it for a sandwich, because there are tons of other leaves on the ground. It isn’t worth my time and money to find the ingredients to make you a sandwich when I could go pick up a leaf off the ground myself. That’s scarcity. We also can’t use things that are easy to introduce into the currency system; look up David O’Keefe and the Yap Rai stones. If it’s easy to introduce more currency into the currency system, it severely devalues the currency to the point of being worthless (like the modern Venezuelan currency or Aggri beads in Africa). The relationship of how much we have to how much we can introduce is called stock-to-flow, and it’s why gold is “the gold standard.” We have a decent amount of it in the system already, but because it’s rare, hard and costly to mine, and hard and costly to refine, there’s a practical limit to how much can be added to the system. The amount of new gold introduced to the world economy every year is only like 1.5% of what already was there. The higher the stock-to-flow ratio, the better use it is for currency. The only reason the American dollar has any value is because a whole bunch of people have agreed that it has value… Once upon a time, the governments said “we know it’s really hard to carry around all this heavy gold. Just give it to us and we’ll hold onto it for you and we’ll give you these paper receipts instead. If you want to buy something, you can give them this receipt and they can bring it to us to get the gold.” As time went on, people trusted the government money (“Fiat currency,” after the Latin word “Fiat” for “mandate”) more and more, and stopped bothering to ask to get the gold back. So now, the Fiat currency isn’t practically backed by anything except public trust and complacency, which is what I mean when I say that people have agreed it has value. Now when the government wants to engage in a military conflict or give out more in welfare or start giving out more money for whatever, they don’t actually have to do anything except print more money, which is causing the same issues as with the Rai stones. This problem of pumping more dollars into the system and reducing the dollar’s worth is one of the problems Bitcoin seeks to solve. It also seeks to solve the more modern problem of “this is my money and no government should be telling me what to do with it or confiscating it.” There’s a finite amount of bitcoins that will ever be produced because there’s a technological limit built in, and no government is able to artificially regulate it, the free market does.

With Bitcoin, the way it was designed is that the computers on the network essentially use processing power to write down the transactions completed. The first one who does it and gets it verified by the other computers gets a reward for all its hard work in the form of a certain amount of Bitcoins. Initially, the reward was 50 bitcoins. If it stayed that way forever, it would either continue forever and would ruin the stock-to-flow, or it would run out eventually and it would be like a car slamming full speed into a tree. To avoid either, there are built-in “halvings,” where the amount of reward is reduced by half, so computers would first win 50, then 25 as of 2012, then 12.5 as of 2016, then 6.25, then 3.125 as of earlier this year. The next one is expected in 2028, but they’re based on the number of blocks added to the chain so it isn’t a fixed date. This halving essentially does the frog in the water thing where it smooths the transition from creating bitcoins to not. There’s only ever going to be a fixed number of bitcoins, approximately 21 million of them. This is because of the halvings. The 2028 halving will take us down to 1.56, then 0.78, then 0.39, then 0.19, etc. It creates a mathematical asymptote, where the reward doesn’t actually touch zero, but it gets so small that it may as well be.";chinook_bunting;;3;0.0;2024-11-17;23:10:30;Comment;" Your question about what causes it to have value is really asking what the basis of money is.

;"So, first off when planning to retire you should think out 30 years or till you're 65. Anything under those two will require hard work and sacrifice if you wish to keep your standard of living. Life shouldn't be this way but it is if you're playing on Normal.

With Bitcoin you should be able to do better than Normal, but there are still some things to consider. Are you in a job that has a 401(K) and an HSA? Do you have a Roth IRA going? Do you make too much to do a Roth IRA? If you want to retire early then you should be maximizing out these retirement buckets, and sacrificing at least 25% of your income to retirement right now. 

Are you completely sold on Bitcoin and look at Bitcoin as the apex asset? You can gear these retirement products towards Bitcoin investments, such as Bitcoin Roth IRAs, investing in ETFs through your HSA, etc.... Maybe you have no control over your 401(k) but maximize your employer match because that right their is an instant 100% ROI then compounded with what is likely much smaller returns than Bitcoin but it is already doubled. 

I got into Bitcoin and crypto back in late 2020. I am literally magnitudes better off now because of that choice, but taking care of debt and understanding investing better is what led up to me being able to really benefit from Bitcoin and crypto. 

It takes time. Compound interest takes time. Bitcoin looks to be the best asset in the world for compound interest. Make sacrifices now so you can enjoy retirement when it comes, and hopefully it will come early for you. 

Last thing, if Bitcoin is going to continue to see high rates of return, even if diminishing slightly on average each year, then at some point you can theoretically own enough Bitcoin where you can sell a portion to continue to live at your current lifestyle and you will never run out of Bitcoin before you die because the value will increase faster than your spending.";LoquaciousLethologic;;17;0.0;2024-11-17;20:22:37;Comment;" So, first off when planning to retire you should think out 30 years or till you're 65.

> It's pretty simple really. I think the architecture of bitcoin (decentralized crypto-currency with pre-determined and transparent supply expansion, tailing off to zero) is superior to our current central bank issued currencies. If that's true, then bitcoin is poised to take the lead in a roughly 30-80 trillion dollar market. The value of bitcoins in such a case would be well over $100,000+ (over a million is still a realistic scenario). Thus I don't think a price runup to 235 dollars is anything to blink at. Is it speculation? Sure. But what matters is whether that speculation turns out to be right or not.

> Bitcoin is a commodity designed to have ideal properties to serve as money. A lot of people contend that it has no intrinsic value, but that's only if you think the function of money has no value. Sure, all you ""own"" with bitcoin is a key (a string of letters and numbers), but that key has been agreed upon by the users of the bitcoin network to serve as your ownership claim to your portion of a distributed credit ledger. Gold is not valued at its price for its industrial utility, otherwise 99% of the world's supply would not be sitting in vaults, safes, or jewelry boxes. Gold is valued because it's an undeniable ownership claim to what society has voluntarily agreed to use as a distributed credit ledger - one that can't be inflated by a central authority; just like bitcoin.

> What's happening to bitcoin is the rapid monetization of a commodity. It's unprecedented in the history of the world because cryptocurrency is completely new. Previous to bitcoin, the clear #1 commodity money was gold, and it was monetized gradually in ancient history. 5 years ago, a potentially even better commodity money dropped in our laps. This is a highly disruptive event, and if it does get monetized on a wide scale it's going to be unlike anything civilization has ever seen.

> This may sound like hyperbole, but money is a huge deal to society, and the emergence of a new commodity money with as much potential as bitcoin is completely unprecedented. People like to bring up tulips as some sort of analogy, but this misses the point that tulips were not designed to be money. They in fact have terrible qualities to serve as money. Bitcoin is designed to be the bubble that doesn't pop because the bubble itself is useful. That's what money is.

The US bond market alone accounts for about 35 trillion (edit - I derped and should clarify that ""only"" ~14 trillion of that would be US gov bonds, however the global total for risk free govt bonds still adds up to around 40 trillion).

Please any advice or a link to a safe and trusted guide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks again and hodl and stack on bothers and sisters!"

If you get the password to your hardware wallet wrong 3 times will your bitcoin automatically get sent back to your cold wallet?;Very new to all of this, I don’t actually have any bitcoin yet unfortunately. Trying to learn how it all works first.

;"I don’t think you can use their app without your hardware wallet. There are other apps for your phone where you can just use that instead, but yes you’re correct in understanding that the benefit of the hardware wallet is that you don’t have to expose the seed that is the key to all your funds on an internet connected device.

You could literally have your hardware device obliterated, and then you could just buy a new one and input your seed on that one and your bitcoin would magically appear and be accessible again.

The way this works is that bitcoin only actually exists on the blockchain, which is a distributed database running on Bitcoin nodes hosted independently all around the world.

You can input your seed to anything that understands how to use a private key to assess your bitcoin and sign transactions for you to broadcast to the Bitcoin network to move your coins to a new address (how Bitcoin is ‘sent’), but there are risks all over the place with people trying to separate you from your Bitcoin for obvious reasons.

Also I’m not sure your last question makes much sense. Your hardware wallet can be secured by a pin and other security measures like using the sd card for pin encryption and erasing on too many pin attempts, but you wouldn’t want to use a cold wallet in addition to a hot wallet with the same seed as that makes your security as weak as the hot wallet.

You can view your balances of a cold wallet on an Internet connected device without too much risk (look into xpubs) but again you’d never want to use your cold wallet seed on a hot wallet or ever let anyone or anything see it.";142NonillionKelvins;;1;0.0;2024-11-17;17:29:03;Comment;" I don’t think you can use their app without your hardware wallet.

First Time Buying Bitcoin in the UAE – Seeking Advice on My Investment Strategy;"Hey everyone,

This is my first time purchasing Bitcoin, and I'm planning to start investing here in the UAE. I've done some research, but I’d love to hear your advice and feedback from those with more experience!

Here’s my plan:

I plan to invest 2000 AED (Around $550) this month as a starting point.

After that, I’m aiming to invest 500 AED (Around $140) every month consistently.

My strategy is to HODL for the long term, with no intention of selling anytime soon.


A few things I’d like advice on:

1. Best platforms to buy Bitcoin in the UAE – Are there any platforms with low fees or better security?


2. Any tips on storing Bitcoin securely – I’m thinking of using a hardware wallet, but not sure which one is best for beginners.


3. Is my monthly investment plan reasonable – Should I adjust my amount or frequency based on market trends or other factors?


4. Any other tips for a first-time investor – Things I should know before I start.



Looking forward to hearing from you all!

>safest and easiest

Safest =/= easiest. That's for sure.

We all have been where you're at, read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners and look for the answers.";Amber_Sam;;2;0.0;2024-11-17;15:17:04;Comment;"

Cons:

\- You are only able to buy and sell during stock trading hours (so 9-4 EST during the week). As a result, you can't take out your money out on the weekend or put money in.

;"Gold was that to some degree, hence why it was used as currency for thousands of years in many civilizations. But Gold isn't completely self evident. You need to confirm that the Gold is real for one, that it wasn't debased and if someone physically steals it from you, how do you prove that it was your Gold?

;"Gold would be that if it had better monetary properties. Specifically, it's not easily divisible, verifiable, or even very portable. (Despite being the most portable money in human history before bitcoin.)

So since people found it hard to transact with their gold coins and nuggets, banks had to step in and offer a more portable, divisible, verifiable proxy for gold, a.k.a. coinage & bills.

Those are what it took to ""scale"" gold up to everyday transactional usage. They didn't really compete with gold at all until 1971, and only acted as gold's layer 2 technology, the same as we see the lightning network.

So before 1971, gold had by proxy a form of ownership without authority, because the coinage was just a stand-in for something that you can own off the books. After 1971, the money wasn't linked to gold at all anymore and many would argue that any physical item you use as your primary store of value will suffer the same fate in time.

Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act 2024 (HB 2664);"This legislation will allow Pennsylvania's State Treasurer to invest up to 10% of the State General Fund, the Rainy Day Fund, and the State Investment Fund in Bitcoin.

I think that we are going to have to do a little bit of political activism here because when I called my State Representative's Harrisburg office on Friday to let them know that it is important to me that they support this bill the staff who I spoke with told me that becasue Representative Michael Cabell's (the Representative who introduced the bill) term will end on November 30th it is unlikely that this bill will go anywhere.

We need to get at least one of our District Representatives to sign on to co-sponsor this legislation. If you are from Pennsylvania it is crucial that you contact your House Representative right away and ask them to do this.

We have a real chance here to be the first state to do this and we all know why the first state to get this done will be the one that benefits the most.

[https://www.house.state.pa.us/](https://www.house.state.pa.us/)

This is the website. You can click to find the Representative for your district. It will show all of their contact information. You can call their office or send them an email. Make sure to mention the specific bill number and name which is HB 2664 Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act 2024. Tell them why it is a good idea and how their support for this is important to you. They understand that even if your influence is small with only your family and friends that can still mean a lot for them.

We are contacting the Representatives now because the bill has been introduced to the House last week. If it goes though we will be contacting our Senators later.

Also, even if you are not from Pennsylvania it would be great if you want to help out by passing this information on to anyone you know who is a Pennsylvania resident becasue progress on this will greatly benefit our entire Bitcoin community all over the world.

Bybit Account Blocked (Code 30031) - No Response from Compliance for Over 1.5 Months;"Hello everyone,

I’m reaching out here because I don’t know what else to do. My Bybit account was blocked with the error code **30031**, and I was asked to provide additional information for their compliance review. I promptly submitted all the requested details, but it’s been over **1.5 months**, and I haven’t received any updates from the Compliance team.

Whenever I contact support, they just send me automated responses, saying to email the Compliance team directly. Unfortunately, the Compliance team doesn’t reply to my emails at all. I’m left in limbo with no way to know what’s happening or how much longer this will take.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How long do these compliance reviews typically take? Is there anything I can do to expedite the process or get some clarity?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I’m reaching out here because I don’t know what else to do. My Bybit account was blocked with the error code **30031**, and I was asked to provide additional information for their compliance review. I promptly submitted all the requested details, but it’s been over **1.5 months**, and I haven’t received any updates from the Compliance team.

Whenever I contact support, they just send me automated responses, saying to email the Compliance team directly. Unfortunately, the Compliance team doesn’t reply to my emails at all. I’m left in limbo with no way to know what’s happening or how much longer this will take.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How long do these compliance reviews typically take? Is there anything I can do to expedite the process or get some clarity?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance!"

If I were the Fed, here's what my strategy would be;"First, I want to preface this, that this is wild game theory speculation. Do with that what you will.

Now that a Bitcoin-friendly administration is taking office, I could fathom an idea of how the Federal Reserve might try to prove themselves relevant and necessary.

The Fed have begun to reduce interest rates. All of a sudden, there is a pro-Bitcoin president and administration. Time to enact the plan to further disuade the public from buying into Bitcoin. It needs to remain widely unaccepted, from perspective of the Fed.

The Fed has a dual mandate; Promote Maximum Employment, and Stable Prices. There is a social contract between the Fed and the nation. The Fed continues to maintain its dominance as long as it acts in the ""best interest"" of the nation, following the dual mandate.

The chief tool the Fed has at its disposal is control of the federal interest rate. They might lower the interest rate to ease pressure on banks and citizens. Lowering the rates is akin to hitting the accelerator on inflation. Raise the interest rate, and it tightens monetary policy, putting stress on banks, businesses, and citizens which leads to higher unemployment. Raising interest rates has a tendency to be a brake on inflation. They give this 2% nominal inflation number, but never define it. I would guess it is the rate they found in the system to keep the fiat going as long as they can, knowing it'll eventually fail. They'd never want inflation to drop to 0%, let alone result in deflation.

Deflation is a terrible outcome in the inflationary systems we have today, it could trigger another Depression. But how convenient that Bitcoin happens to be a deflationary asset. It's whole system is anathema to the fiat system.

If I were the Fed, seeing Bitcoin adoption rising at the National stage now, I might have incentive to pivot hawkish, regardless that things are already riding the edge as it is. I might have an opportunity to push the nation into a depression and get the economy as close to deflation as possible, and use that narrative to ""show"" why Bitcoin is bad because it is deflationary, and look what deflation gets you, a crashed market (the everything bubble pops).

The difference remains that Bitcoin is designed to be a deflationary system, and the incentive structure aligns with benefiting the many, not the few. Just as deflation in an inflationary system is bad for it, inflation is bad for a deflationary system. Bitcoin removes that risk through the use of incentives, a change to the max supply affects your own wealth. Whereas, the Cantillon Effect protects the Central Bankers.

Why would the Fed elect pain? In order to place the blame on Bitcoin for the negative deflation effects, misrepresenting it as what a deflationary system will do to our world economy. I think of it similar to the AC/DC wars between Edison and Tesla. Edison wanted to show how dangerous AC was and defame Tesla, by killing elephants and other animals using AC. Unfortunately for him, AC was proven safer, as he found it very difficult to kill any animals using AC. So Edison opted to using DC to kill animals fast, but just lie about it and say it was AC. Today, AC is used almost everywhere, while DC is relegated to electronics and contained systems. DC was found to be inferior to transportation of energy. It required bulky cables and more power plants between locations. Inefficient, just like our current fiat system. AC could travel longer distances, with far fewer resources. AC was flexible, in that it can be stepped up or down through tranformers. Much more efficient.

Tldr; The incentives exist for the Fed to wage a defamation battle against Bitcoin in an effort to maintain control.

If I were the central bank in charge of the current world reserve currency, and props up forever proxy wars around the world, I would do whatever it took to delay the inevitable toppling.

It's also very easy to let them cook when you don't feel like you've invested a lot in the asset and you really have nothing to lose.

When you DCA you would need to have quite some spare money to have put in to reach a million dollar at this moment.

Next the moment of buying in the four year cycle can make a big difference so that needs to be good as well or you will need another cycle / a few years more.

But if you do things right those last cycles make it go fast.
Starting with a $100k will get you to a million if the cycle delivers a ten fold.

Best DCA strategy?;So River has quite a few different frequencies to dollar cost average with. Standard ones like daily, biweekly, weekly...etc. They even have one that will dollar cost average every 1hr. I was curious if anyone knows if there is an advantage to DCA at higher frequencies like every 1hr. They dont charge fees on recurring buys so that isn't a factor. ;infoglutton;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gt3i97/best_dca_strategy/;7;7.0;2024-11-17;02:26:47;Post;Best DCA strategy?

;"you’re not thinking about it correctly. every time someone dies and their private key is lost or destroyed you are making every other hodler richer fairly because the circulating supply is reduced evenly for every hodler because bitcoin becomes more scarce and therefore the price goes up.

it’s impossible to fairly distribute bitcoin because who decides? what are the rules to decide? this becomes a centralized point of failure. if bitcoin is handed out randomly what if an already wealthy wallet gets the bitcoin? if you make a rule about limiting bitcoin wallets, what is the limit? it’s too complicated and actually more unfair to give out bitcoin.

the fairest scenario is that it is up to every individual to obtain bitcoin however they can and as much as they can. then as people die, they destroy their private key or if people don’t die but just lose their private key, it means every other hodler remaining gets richer equally because the circulating supply is reduced for everyone which makes bitcoin more scarce which makes the price go up for everyone hodling. ";llewsor;;1;0.0;2024-11-17;01:44:25;Comment;" you’re not thinking about it correctly. every time someone dies and their private key is lost or destroyed you are making every other hodler richer fairly because the circulating supply is reduced evenly for every hodler because bitcoin becomes more scarce and therefore the price goes up.

;"That’s silly. You are missing out on tax benefits both ways. 
401k: 
Traditional: pretax money goes in- gets taxed as earned income in retirement 

Roth: money goes in taxed comes out tax free 
 
HSA: money goes in untaxed comes out untaxed 

You: are currently buying bitcoin with after tax money and will pay capital gains when you sell. (LOSE/LOSE)

I’d suggest putting what you already own in cold storage and start DCA’ing into retirement accounts.

;"Well as others have said, you start to think 3x before spending any sats because what you have is an appreciating asset and using it to buy depreciating or transient things is probably not the way to go. 

However, everyone is free to do as they please. I would say the gotchyas are first going to be possible frauds, swindles so know who or what you are dealing with before you even start transacting. Lots of cons and bots and all sorts trying to get your coins and they don't care whether it's 10 bucks or a million. 

Other common issues are copy/paste poisoning - where you paste in an address to send to but it gets subtly altered between the copy and the paste and so is gone forever. Double-check before hitting that Send button.

;"They do a lot more than that. They are providing bitcoin-backed financial instruments (and their resulting volatility) for capital that can’t be converted into bitcoin itself for various reasons. Listen to their most recent earnings call to hear it from the man.

But capital markets need and want refined bitcoin products just like jets need jet fuel. Microstrategy is much more than just the biggest corporate tank of crude capital.

Examples of refined capital instruments provided by microstrategy: MSTR shares (have crushed the return of BTC and also every company in the SP500), convertible bonds (which have also amazingly outperformed btc in the past year with NO risk of loss of principal), MSTR options that provide the volatility for hedge funds and traders, convertible preferred shares and fixed coupons that provide varying degrees of risk and volatility with the access to bitcoin exposure.

;"That's something you have to calculate for yourself. I think we're going to go to 150k this bull run, and that means it's definitely going to dip below 100k. A 50% drawdown from absolute peak to absolute bottom is normal for BTC. But if you think that we're going past 200k, then I get why you think we won't ever see 5 figures again. I just personally think it's a bit too early for that.

This will be the first cycle where we break 6 figures to begin with, surely it'd be a bit silly to think people aren't going to try and take profits once we get there. I'd even go one step further and say we'll see the 60-70k range again (for a very short period of time, like we hit sub-20k in '22).

Anyway, good luck on your journey. 90k isn't too bad of a price to take a loan out, but just know it could also permanently wreck you financially if you can't pay it back in time.

;No no, I've been through three cycles now, I hate sharing anything useful when we're into a run but this one is really begging me too. Euphoria is a process, not a feeling. You'll know you're there because you'll see months of optimistic behavior and sky is the limit talking. It doesn't happen all at once. It happens when you see all these new influencers come to the space, you see people at the grocery store talking about it. It's on every new headline and this will continue like I said for months. So if you want to kind of broad stroke the euphoria cycle, in 2017 it wasn't until we were about 10,000 and last cycle it was kind of weird because we had that double top. It really was hard to figure out then because you began to move into it on the first run to 60k then it disappeared and kind of rolled over into alt coins and re-accelerated. If there's anything to be on the lookout for, it's something strange like that where psychology doesn't move in a gradual line.

We'll see if this ends up like 2020, where the bulk of the rally happens from now into the early part of next year, topping out maybe around March, possibly April, then maybe a lull for the summer before a final push to a new high in the fall before the next year-long bear market sets in.

Withdrawal advice;"Hey everyone. 

Assuming I've been investing in bitcoin for 20 years, I'm retired and want to enjoy. How would I go about living off my investemnts?

Do I withdraw a little bit every month by converting it back into fiat but then tax would be annoying or do I withdraw how much I think I would need for a year? Not sure if the country I'm in(south africa) allows me to pay for everything in bitcoin.

Just not sure how to use it at the end.

My fellow bitcoiners;"My fellow bitcoiners, throughout history, the great nations and great individuals have been those who saw the opportunities of their age and seized them with boldness and resolve. We now stand on the cusp of a revolution, not in lands or empires, but in the very foundations of money itself—Bitcoin.

Just as the pioneers tamed the wilderness, Bitcoin offers a frontier that demands our courage and conviction. It is a scarce resource, immutable and incorruptible, born not of government decree but of innovation and liberty. In an age of monetary uncertainty, where inflation erodes the savings of the diligent, Bitcoin stands as a bastion of individual sovereignty and generational security.

Do not be timid in your actions. The 21 million Bitcoin represent a finite resource, as scarce as the land claimed by our forebears. It is our duty, to ourselves and to future generations, to claim our stake in this frontier before it is closed to us. Imagine what one Bitcoin could mean to your descendants in a century—a treasure of unparalleled worth in a world increasingly driven by scarcity and competition.

I implore you, do not shrink from this opportunity. Just as our nation’s greatness was built by those who had the vision to plant seeds for a future they would never see, so too must we secure this foundation of freedom and wealth for those who will inherit our legacy.

In the words I have always cherished: ‘Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.’ Act boldly and seize this moment, for history will remember the ones who had the foresight to act in the face of opportunity.”

;"You are alive during the most pivotal financial revolution in human history. Bitcoin—the only truly finite, incorruptible form of money—is still within reach. But that will not last. This moment, right now, is the equivalent of being alive when land was being claimed, or when the first drops of oil were discovered. Yet, unlike land or oil, Bitcoin is mathematically guaranteed to become scarcer with time, and the world is only beginning to understand its profound value.

200 years from now, your descendants are living in a world where Bitcoin has solidified as the planet’s ultimate store of value. By then, no new Bitcoin will be mined. Millions will have been permanently lost, and the remaining supply—perhaps just a few million—will serve as the financial bedrock for the entire global economy. What would it mean for your family if they held even a single Bitcoin? What if you, today, had the chance to secure their future empire, and you ignored it?

This is about more than wealth; this is about legacy. The actions you take now could shape your bloodline for centuries. If you accumulate and preserve Bitcoin, you could be the person who sets your family apart for generations, ensuring that your name is remembered in the story of human advancement.

But here’s the catch: this opportunity demands urgency and discipline. Bitcoin’s adoption is accelerating. Governments, corporations, and nations are beginning to stake their claim. Every Bitcoin that enters long-term custody is one less available for you. Soon, accumulating even fractions of a Bitcoin will become nearly impossible for the average person.

And when that day comes—when the world fully realizes Bitcoin’s potential—your descendants will ask one question: ‘Did you act when you had the chance?’ You have the power to ensure your family’s financial sovereignty in a future that will be defined by scarcity, competition, and a global fight for value.

The time is now. To secure this gift is not just an opportunity—it is a duty. This is not about indulging in the lifestyle it could afford today. It’s about preserving it for tomorrow. It’s about giving your bloodline the foundation to thrive in a world where most will be left behind. Do not let this moment pass. You may hold the key to your family’s empire for the next 300 years.

Millions will have been permanently lost, and the remaining supply—perhaps just a few million—will serve as the financial bedrock for the entire global economy. What would it mean for your family if they held even a single Bitcoin? What if you, today, had the chance to secure their future empire, and you ignored it?

This is about more than wealth; this is about legacy. The actions you take now could shape your bloodline for centuries. If you accumulate and preserve Bitcoin, you could be the person who sets your family apart for generations, ensuring that your name is remembered in the story of human advancement.

But here’s the catch: this opportunity demands urgency and discipline. Bitcoin’s adoption is accelerating. Governments, corporations, and nations are beginning to stake their claim. Every Bitcoin that enters long-term custody is one less available for you. Soon, accumulating even fractions of a Bitcoin will become nearly impossible for the average person.

And when that day comes—when the world fully realizes Bitcoin’s potential—your descendants will ask one question: ‘Did you act when you had the chance?’ You have the power to ensure your family’s financial sovereignty in a future that will be defined by scarcity, competition, and a global fight for value.

The time is now. To secure this gift is not just an opportunity—it is a duty. This is not about indulging in the lifestyle it could afford today. It’s about preserving it for tomorrow. It’s about giving your bloodline the foundation to thrive in a world where most will be left behind. Do not let this moment pass. You may hold the key to your family’s empire for the next 300 years. The question is: will you claim it?"

;"I don't think there are many exchanges accepting CC any longer.  Debit cards, yes but not CC because of chargeback and other issues. I think most card companies themselves block known crypto payment processors.  

So if you can get a 0 interest card you'd probably need to take cash from it and put it elsewhere before being able to trade. I think in most cases, the 0% only apply to card charges, and interest accrues on cash withdrawals.

Why I think that this Bullrun will be different;"We can all agree about the value proposition that bitcoin provides. Some of us saw it earlier than others, but the world is starting to see it in new ways. We see Saylor’s Microstrategy, ETFs and Gov’t adoption as a strategic investment. One of the main complaints from Buttcoiners and the general public is that it is too easy to hack or lose your keys. And while any somewhat technically savvy individual could manage their own keys, it is probably more hassle than the average person wanted to subject themselves. With the introduction of ETFs, we have now opened the door to the investment community.  If I want to buy more bitcoin, I can just hop onto my brokerage account and buy all I want and sell for that matter. While some of you may cry “Not your keys!!”, the average person was only going to be convinced if it was offered via the same avenues as other investments. This is only the beginning of widespread adoption…it might look a tad bid different than some of us expected but it was one of the few ways widespread was feasible. The infusion of investment will be to a scale unlike any we have seen in the past.  Cheers brothers/sisters and good luck in your Hodling!

Expat can't figure out how to buy bitcoin;"Hi all,

  
Let me start by saying I am a citizen of the world, French nationality, living in Thailand currently with bank accounts in USA and Hong Kong.

I've been looking to diversify my investment portfolio and buy some crypto to hold for long term. I started doing some research and finally downloaded Binance.

I was planning to fund my Binance account, buy some bitcoin and then learn to transfer them to a cold wallet and hold onto it for the next 10 years or so.

Problem is, the only options I see available to fund the account is by credit card with some crazy rate or go through the P2P where all the offers have different drawbacks.

Came onto here to see if any other international expats ran into the same problem and what exchange platform you managed to use for the lowest fees?

 PSA: Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins - A Hard-Learned Lesson ;"Just wanted to drop a friendly reminder that hits close to home: **Not your keys, not your coins** isn't just some catchphrase – it's real advice that I really wish I'd taken seriously before losing money in the FTX collapse.

Keeping coins on exchanges is convenient. It's easy to trade, the UI is slick, and cold storage seems like a hassle. But remember:

* Exchanges can freeze your assets
* They can get hacked
* They can go bankrupt (thanks, FTX!)

If you're holding any significant amount of crypto, please take the time to:

1. Get a hardware wallet
2. Learn how to use it properly
3. Keep your seed phrase secure (not on your phone/computer)
4. Only keep trading amounts on exchanges

I learned this lesson the expensive way in 2022 and I'm feeling like this advice needs to be repeated now that the next bull is coming. Don't be like me – protect your coins. The small inconvenience of self-custody is nothing compared to the pit in your stomach when you realize your exchange account is frozen and your funds are gone.

Bitcoin is my Retirement Bonus;"I’m 15 years from retirement. I’ve been employed full time since graduating University with a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (no student loan) and during this time I’ve maxed out my company-sponsored retirement account up to the point where they match my contribution (ranging from 2x to 4x my contribution). I’ve also paid into Social Security, of course. Based on my calculations, I’ll be able to retire if I downsize my living expenses and lifestyle. I’ll be able to do this, but I won’t like it.

This is where Bitcoin comes in 😎 My time horizon is 15+ years, I’m DCA-ing with money left over after paying my bills (no debt) and enjoying life (vacations, gifts, experiences, stuff). If BTC goes to $0, I’ll be OK. If it continues to grow as it has, it will be worth more than my entire career’s retirement savings (x some multiplier!), which means my retirement will change from being just OK, yet enjoyable, to being very nice indeed. I see this as icing on the cake, a nice bonus, so to speak. Again, I’m enjoying life currently, living in the moment, and saving for retirement … and on the side, building my bitcoin stack for a potentially nice bonus when I retire.

Just sharing with you my strategy (with time horizon).

Lately my portfolio went parabolic so I started looking into ways of sharing with my wife about what should be done in case something happens to me.

As of now, she only knows the portfolio value and that I've invested in crypto. She knows nothing about which crypto, doesn't understand how exchanges work neither what a cold wallet is.

How do I give her clear instructions on how to react in case I won't be able to cash out?

I thought of walking her through all the procedures, but I'm afraid it could be too much for her.

I also thought of leaving written details on a password protected usb stick or creating a legacy video in which I explain everything step by step. I plan on storing the video on a password protected usb stick. She will be the only one that has acces to the usb stick and its info

I now store some of my holdings on an Exchange and most of the bag is in a cold wallet, passphrase protected.

;"Yes. As long as you have liquidity to Boltz for the amount you want to swap, they're great.

An alternative is swapping to Liquid. This would be what I would do if I don't have enough liquidity for the amount I'm swapping.

;"Yeah then this is probably a good way to save on fees. But you do still pay the mining fee with Boltz. On chain withdrawal from the exchange is one less step, and often cheaper.

But withdrawing via Lightning and Boltz is better for privacy, absolutely. If you want to maximise that, you could send direct to the Aqua wallet spending account, which is Liquid by default under the hood. Then, swap out on more time to on chain, and you get 2 privacy hops with two different third parties.

;"I'm from El Salvador and here's my hot take regarding how bitcoin communities will develop: I think it's still too early to tell.   
  
Let me explain: Last month I visited El Zonte after many years (been living abroad). When I was growing up, that place was an absolutely unknown shanty town. Unless you were a surfer who knew the spot, literally nobody went there, despite how absolutely beautiful the scenery is (pictures don't make it justice). 

Went there twice, once during the week and once on the weekend. As a first impression I was pleasantly surprised that, (most) roads have been paved. There's also a lot of private construction going on everywhere and there has been a lot done already. Never in my wildest dreams I thought I'd see a building taller than 2 stories there. There are still some empty plots of land but I was told those are going for 6-7 figures now due to increased demand.

The place is packed but not in a bad way I'd say. It's full of tourists, both foreigners and locals, but everyone just gets along and is super friendly with each other. Even my friends were telling me how they preferred going there instead of other beach towns just because of how chill it is. I appreciate how respectful everyone who has come from abroad is and how they try to integrate into the community. The vibe is incredible. 

And yes, you can pay with bitcoin in most places (I obviously didn't check all of them).

However, you can tell that there is still some level of poverty. Rundown houses where the locals live, kids roaming around aimlessly, street vendors, that sort of thing.  

I think that in 15-20 years, it's going to be a VERY different place, though. I got the feeling that the community is working really hard for the place to develop. I see the potential, it's there for sure, but it's still going to take time. Right now, it feels like a huge science project everyone is taking part in. All in all, cool experience, worth a visit. 

On a side note: Some Salvadorans argue that those type of places are getting too expensive for them, as the general wages in the country have not raised that much yet. I get it. A hostel there a couple of years ago could cost you $40-50 and today they go for $90-100. However, that seems to be a natural consequence of places that see an increase in tourism.

What do you think;"Hey guys I'm pretty new to this and just wanted to hear your opinion.

Im 22 years old and have 1/4 of a bitcoin. I know its not a lot but I don't have a high paying job and its the best I have been able to do so far. What I have is worth 22,000 right now which makes me really happy that I started buying when it was 50k.

My parents are super into bitcoin which is how I got into this.

How much bitcoin do I need to get for this to make a big difference in my life? If it takes off, will what I have become a lot? What do you guys think? I am in an internship right now but will be in my first full time job next fall making around 50-60k so will be able to start buying more hopefully.

;"It's natural to want reassurance, but the hard truth is that no one knows.

Every investment has risk & every individual has a different tolerance for risk.

You are in the bitcoin subreddit so of course you are going to get a lot of positive responses, but you need to decide for yourself what your own risk tolerance is.

The best thing you can do for yourself is learn more about bitcoin. When I had my ""a-ha"" moment with bitcoin it wasn't because bitcoin price was going up, it was because I understood its role & potential impact on a broken economy. That didn't come quickly. It was after months of going down the rabbit hole on how money & economies work.

My advice, get started now for small amounts & as you learn more, if your conviction grows, continue buying. If you're not convinced, then don't. 

If you're merely buying because ""number go up"" then you are not ready because you'll be the first person to panic sell when it crashes. And it WILL crash.

BITCOIN FOR TIME!;"Yo, listen up Bitcoiners, I just had a freakin’ epiphany while pounding the pavement on my morning run through the streets of Fethiye, Turkey. 🌅 And I’m not talking about some weak “got an idea” moment. I’m talking a full-on bolt of lightning straight to the brain ⚡️.

So there I was, sweating my guts out, and it hit me—money, my dudes, is a straight-up scam. It’s like trying to hold sand in your hands: always slipping through your fingers, losing value year after year. And let me tell you, hyperinflation in Turkey? It’s real AF. But even the almighty US dollar? It’s basically on life support. 🚑

So while I was dodging stray cats and kebab stands, I thought, “If the USD is crumbling, what chance does the BRICS meme-currency even have?” Spoiler: none.

💥 Then it hit me like a freight train—Bitcoin is THE only real answer. It’s the ONLY thing that makes sense as a world reserve currency that actually holds up. Unlike the USD or whatever the BRICS gang tries to cook up, Bitcoin is bulletproof against manipulation, dilution, and inflation. 💣

And here’s the mic drop moment: Bitcoin is the only way to store your TIME. Think about it—time is the one thing you can’t print more of, can’t inflate, can’t “stimulate” with BS policies. It’s the hardest, realest asset on this planet. ⏳ We all get our finite slice, and once it’s gone, it’s game over.

So why the hell are we letting our precious time be compensated in fiat toilet paper that’s losing value faster than your ex’s Instagram followers? 🚀 We should be demanding our wages in the hardest damn money on Earth.

🔊 BITCOIN FOR TIME! 🔊

Time is priceless, my friends. Stop trading it for fiat trash that depreciates faster than a Lambo on a gravel road. It’s time to wake up, stack sats, and secure the bag.

;"That’s not how hyperinflation comes about in the USA. They also have no plans to pay off the debt. 

The hyperinflation of 1920s Germany, Zimbabwe, Argentina, etc…isn’t really the way it will go in the USA. The USA pays its debt in the currency it issues and because it’s debt, like almost all global debt, is denominated in dollars once it reaches the top of the food chain the US Dollar is the most salable good on earth.  

Hyperinflation for two reasons 

1. When currency issuing countries have debts to pay that are denominated in another currency and the debtor nation’s currency is undesirable for any number of reasons. 

2. When currency issuing countries struggle to export more than they import when it comes to essential goods. They are forced to buy important goods like fuel and pharmaceuticals etc…usually the country they are buying from doesn’t want currency of the purchasing country so they either demand dollars or the demand a huge premium in the purchasing currency. 

So, when you owe money to other nations (which the US does not) and you can’t establish an economic ground game, your only option is to print like crazy, pay the debt before the prices all change and then start over. 

USA don’t owe money to other countries at least not the way a household or a business owes money to a bank. The US owes money to other countries the way a bank owes you money if you want to come withdraw your cash along with interest while they hold onto it. Since the dollar and US government backed securities are the most guaranteed assets in the world, no country, at least for 30-50 years is going to come ask for their money back. They are just gonna leave it in the bank at the Fed and collect the interest and then add that to the pile.

;"Market cap in crypto doesn’t work the same as in traditional assets, so your comparison doesn’t really hold up. It’s just the total supply multiplied by the current price, which is set by the last trade on an exchange. That means even a small trade can make the market cap look massive—it doesn’t reflect the actual money invested.

For example, if someone buys 1 BTC at $10 million, the market cap jumps to $210 trillion, but it doesn’t mean $210 trillion has been poured into Bitcoin. It’s more of a theoretical number, not a measure of real value or liquidity.

So yeah, $210 trillion sounds crazy, but it’s not impossible in terms of market cap—it’s just not the same as actual money in the system.

Remember when people were clowning El Salvador for buying BTC?;"I came across an old video of NowThis News making sure to FUD Bitcoin when it went into its expected typical bear market in 2022. FUD’ing how El Salvador is going to default over investing in a risky asset. I figured this was going to pay off well for El Salvador. 

What I hate about this news source is you can guarantee they’re not going to cover how good of an investment this was for El Salvador, and wait until the next bear market to discuss all the negative stories of those who lost money in the space.

Here’s the FUD story from NowThis if you’re curious. The comments are hilarious to see now that Bitcoin is where it’s at now:

I came across an old video of NowThis News making sure to FUD Bitcoin when it went into its expected typical bear market in 2022. FUD’ing how El Salvador is going to default over investing in a risky asset. I figured this was going to pay off well for El Salvador. 

What I hate about this news source is you can guarantee they’re not going to cover how good of an investment this was for El Salvador, and wait until the next bear market to discuss all the negative stories of those who lost money in the space.

;"I don’t know where you’re getting your numbers from. From what I see El Salvador did this:

As of July 21, 2022, El Salvador has purchased 2,381 bitcoins at an average price of $43,357 USD.

The country announced that it now owns 5,748.76 BTC in May 2024. El Salvador has stated they accuire BTC through daily purchases and mining.

I couldn’t exactly find how much BTC they bought between the time periods of July 21, 2022 to May 2024, but I’m sure they have just continued to buy BTC every day at a flat amount. Let’s be conservative and estimate their average buying price is $40,000. That would mean at the current price right now, they made a profit of 225% over a 3 year period. That would mean a yearly profit of 75%. That’s way more of a profit than what the S&P 500 performed at in its best year of 2024 so far. 

It’s also a success story in the aspect that a portion of the BTC bought was from miners using natural volcanic power. So not only was it’s buying of Bitcoin a success story, but using natural volcanic power to mine BTC to provide money and power to the country was another example of how this is a success story.

Yeah I mean I looked at all those sources, and they don’t really say anything about how much Bitcoin was bought for an average price. My source above is the only source about that.

;"I only compared 2024 because you brought it up. 

And if we are to compared S&P to BTC January 2021 to now.

S&P up 57%

BTC up 217%

As it stands, the S&P can't beat BTC over any stretch. And the longer the period, the less favorable it looks against it. That trend will continue.";bananabastard;;5;0.0;2024-11-16;05:41:15;Comment;" I only compared 2024 because you brought it up.

;"I think you’re misunderstanding what the IMF is for. It’s not that its only purpose is to make sure a country has money to feed the poor. It’s supposed to promote monetary cooperation, financial stability, encourage economic growth, and trade expansion too. Their whole purpose is supposedly to help nations prosper economically. Not just ensure children aren’t hungry, and a last resort for countries on the brink of collapse.

The IMF is actually there to make you rich. They want countries to have strong economies, but they obviously want favors in return. In this case, more control over countries behaviors/politics. They have a problem with Bitcoin because a country that is more independent with Bitcoin is harder to control now. That’s what this is all about, and why I hate them.";JsCole424;;4;0.0;2024-11-16;04:52:12;Comment;" I think you’re misunderstanding what the IMF is for.
